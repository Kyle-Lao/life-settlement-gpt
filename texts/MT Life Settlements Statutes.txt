certificate holder's assignment, transfer, sale, devise, or bequest of the death benefit or ownership 
of the insurance policy or certificate to the viatical settlement provider.(2) A viatical settlement 
provider may not use a viatical settlement contract in this state unless the viatical settlement 
provider has filed the contract form with the commissioner and the commissioner has approved 
the contract form according to the provisions set forth in 33-1-501. The commissioner shall 
disapprove a viatical settlement contract form if, in the commissioner's judgment, the contract or

entered into in this state must contain a provision enabling the policyholder or certificate holder 
to rescind the contract not later than the 30th day after the date on which the contract is executed 
by all parties or not later than the 15th day after the policyholder or certificate holder receives the

policyholder or certificate holder who has received the proceeds shall return them to the viatical 
settlement provider or financing entity.(4) If a viatical settlement provider enters into a viatical 
settlement that allows the viator to retain an interest in the policy, the viatical settlement contract 
must contain all of the following provisions:(a) that the viatical settlement provider shall effect 
the transfer of the amount of the death benefit only to the extent or portion of the amount 
viaticated. Benefits in excess of the amount viaticated must be paid directly to the viator's 
beneficiary by the insurance company.(b) that the premiums to be paid by the viatical settlement 

provider and the viator will be apportioned unless the viatical settlement contract specifies that 
all premiums must be paid by the viatical settlement provider. The contract may also require that

interest.(c) that the viatical settlement provider shall, upon acknowledgment of the perfection of 
the transfer, either:(i) advise the insured in writing that the insurance company has confirmed the

§ 33-20-1314, MCA 
 
Section 33-20-1315 - Rules - standards - bond 
The commissioner may, in accordance with the provisions of 33-1-313, adopt rules for the 
purpose of carrying out this part. In addition, the commissioner: 
(1) may establish standards for evaluating reasonableness of payments under viatical settlement 
contracts for insured individuals who are terminally ill or chronically ill. The authority includes 
but is not limited to regulation of discount rates used to determine the amount paid in exchange 
for assignment, transfer, sale, devise, or bequest of a benefit under a life insurance policy. For 
the purpose of the standards, the commissioner shall consider payments made in regional and 
national viatical settlement markets to the extent that this information is available, as well as 
model standards developed by the national association of insurance commissioners. When the 
insured is not terminally ill or chronically ill, the commissioner may not establish standards for 
evaluating the reasonableness of payments, except that a viatical settlement provider shall pay an 
amount greater than the greater of the cash surrender value or the accelerated death benefit then 
available.(2) shall require a bond or other mechanism for financial accountability of viatical 
settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers; and(3) shall adopt rules to

Section 33-20-1317 - Disclosure of information to viatical settlement purchasers(1) A viatical 
settlement provider shall disclose the information specified in this section to a viatical settlement 
purchaser prior to the date on which the parties sign the viatical settlement purchase 
agreement.(2) The viatical settlement purchaser shall date and sign the information disclosure. 
The viatical settlement provider shall provide a copy of the information disclosure to the viatical 
settlement purchaser.(3) The information disclosure must include the following:(a) that the 

viatical settlement purchaser will not receive payment until the insured dies;(b) that the actual 
annual rate of return on a viatical settlement purchase agreement is dependent upon an accurate 
projection of the insured's life expectancy and the actual date of the insured's death and that an 
annual guaranteed rate of return is not determinable;(c) that the viatical insurance contract is not 
a liquid purchase since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity, that the funds 
are probably not available until the death of the insured, and that there is not an established

§ 33-20-1317, MCA 
Section 33-20-1318 - Conflict of laws(1) If there is more than one owner on a single life 
insurance policy and the owners are residents of different states, the viatical settlement contract 
is governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest percentage ownership 
resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of one owner agreed upon 

in writing by all of the owners. The law of the state of the insured governs if equal owners fail to 
agree in writing upon a state of residence for jurisdictional purposes.(2)(a) A viatical settlement 
provider from this state who enters into a viatical settlement contract with a viator who is a 
resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted regulations governing viatical 
settlement contracts is governed in the effectuation of that viatical settlement contract by the 
statutes and regulations of the viator's state of residence.(b) A viatical settlement provider from 
this state who enters into a viatical settlement contract with a viator who is a resident of another 
state that has not enacted statutes or adopted regulations governing viatical settlement contracts 
is governed in the effectuation of that viatical settlement contract by the laws of this state. The 
viatical settlement provider shall give the viator notice that this state regulates the transaction 
into which the viator is entering. The viatical settlement provider shall maintain all records 
required by this state and use forms approved in this state.(3) If there is a conflict in the laws that 
apply to a viator and a viatical settlement purchaser in any individual transaction, the laws of the 
state that apply to the viator take precedence and the viatical settlement provider shall comply 
with those laws.
