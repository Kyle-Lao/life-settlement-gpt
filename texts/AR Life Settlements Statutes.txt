submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner 
shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by 
the licensee to engage in the life settlement business or other business subject to the 
commissioner's jurisdiction.(D) Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of any 
license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to § 23-61-301 et seq. and the Arkansas 
Administrative Procedure Act, § 25-15-201 et seq.(3)(A) The commissioner may issue 
subpoenas, administer oaths, and examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the 
examination.(B) Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner 
may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for an order to compel the witness to obey the 
subpoena, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to 
appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.(4) When making an examination under this 
subchapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, 
independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the 
reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the

following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the 
commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath.(B) Upon receipt of the 
verified report, the commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee that has been examined, 
together with a notice that shall afford the licensee that has been examined a reasonable 
opportunity of not more than thirty (30) days to make a written submission or rebuttal with 
respect to any matters contained in the examination report and which shall become part of the 
report or to request a hearing on any matter in dispute.(3) If the commissioner determines that 
regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an examination, the commissioner may initiate any 
proceedings or actions provided by law.(g) CONFIDENTIALITY OF EXAMINATION 
INFORMATION.(1) Names and individual identification data for all owners, purchasers, and 
insureds shall be considered private and confidential information and shall not be disclosed by 
the commissioner unless the disclosure is to another regulator or is required by 
law.(2)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, all examination reports, working 
papers, recorded information, documents and copies thereof produced by, obtained by, or 
disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made under 
this subchapter or in the course of analysis or investigation by the commissioner of the financial 
condition or market conduct of a licensee shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be 
open to inspection to the public or subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act of 
1967, § 25-19-101 et seq., shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery 
or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.(B) The commissioner may use the

brought as part of the commissioner's official duties.(C) The licensee being examined may have 
access to all documents used to make the report.(h) CONFLICT OF INTEREST.(1) An 
examiner shall not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either directly or 
indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary 
interest in any person subject to examination under this subchapter. This subsection does not 
automatically preclude an examiner from being:(A) An owner;(B) An insured in a life settlement 
contract or insurance policy; or(C) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed for a life 
settlement contract.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, the commissioner 
may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public

the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising 
out of activities in carrying out the provisions of this subchapter and the party bringing the action 
was not substantially justified in doing so.(B) For purposes of this subsection, a proceeding is 
"substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was 
initiated.(j) INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSIONER. The commissioner 
may investigate suspected fraudulent life settlement acts and persons engaged in the business of 
life settlements.(k) COST OF EXAMINATIONS. Costs of examinations under this subchapter

fifteen (15) days of the date it is executed by all parties and the owner has received the 
disclosures required by this section.(B) Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if 
both notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, 
and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period.(C) If the insured 
dies during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to 
repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan 
interest to the provider;(6) The fact that proceeds will be sent to the owner within three (3) 
business days after the provider has received the insurer or group administrator's 
acknowledgement that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred 
and the beneficiary has been designated in accordance with the terms of the life settlement 
contract;(7) The fact that entering into a life settlement contract may cause other rights or 
benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the 
policy or certificate of a group policy to be forfeited by the owner, and that assistance should be 

sought from a professional financial advisor;(8) The amount and method of calculating the

about an insured, including the insured's identity or the identity of family members, a spouse, or 
a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life settlement contract between 
the owner and provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to 
consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or 
provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share 
information every two years."; 
(12) The fact that the commissioner shall require providers and brokers to print separate signed

"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or life 
settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison."; 
(13)(A) The fact that the insured may be contacted by either the provider or broker or its

if the insured has a life expectancy of one (1) year or less;(14) The affiliation, if any, between the

conspicuously displayed in any life settlement contract furnished to the owner by a provider, 
including any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the provider and the broker.(c) A

Ark. Code § 23-81-809 
Section 23-81-810 - Disclosure to insurer(a) Without limiting the ability of an insurer from 
assessing the insurability of a policy applicant and determining whether or not to issue the policy 
and in addition to other questions an insurance carrier may lawfully pose to a life insurance 
applicant, insurance carriers may inquire in the application for insurance whether the proposed 
owner intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will use the 
policy as collateral to support the financing.(b) If as described in § 23-81-802(11) the loan 
provides funds that can be used for a purpose other than paying for the premiums, costs, and 
expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the life insurance policy and loan, the 
application shall be rejected as a violation of the prohibited practices in § 23-81-813.(c) If the 
financing does not violate § 23-81-813 in this manner, the insurance carrier:(1) May make 
disclosures, including without limitation to the following, to the applicant and the insured on the 
application or an amendment to the application to be completed no later than the delivery of the 
policy: 
"If you have entered into a loan arrangement in which the policy is used as collateral and the 
policy does change ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the 
following may be true: 
1. A change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;2. A 
change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the 
insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one 
life;3. Should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage 
on the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, and/or 
other factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage and/or may result in significantly higher 
premiums;4. You should consult a professional advisor, since a change in ownership in 
satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure 
of the loan."; and(2) May require certifications, such as the following, from the applicant, the 
insured, or the applicant and the insured:(A) "I have not entered into any agreement or 
arrangement providing for the future sale of this life insurance policy.";(B) "My loan 
arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for some or all of the premiums, 
costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining my life insurance policy, but I 
have not entered into any agreement by which I am to receive consideration in exchange for 
procuring this policy."; and(C) "The borrower has an insurable interest in the insured.". 
Ark. Code § 23-81-810 
Section 23-81-811 - General rules(a) A provider entering into a life settlement contract with any 
owner of a policy when the insured is terminally or chronically ill shall first obtain:(1) If the 
owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of 
sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a life settlement contract; 

and(2) A document in which the insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a 
provider, settlement broker, or insurance producer, and if the policy was issued less than two (2) 
years from the date of application for a life settlement contract, to the insurance company that 
issued the policy.(b)(1) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage 
submitted by a provider, settlement broker, or life insurance producer not later than thirty (30) 
calendar days of the date the request is received.(2) The request for verification of coverage shall 
be made on a form approved by the Insurance Commissioner.(3) The insurer shall complete and 
issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond.(4) In its 
response, the insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents 
provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the 
insurance contract.(c) Before or at the time of execution of the life settlement contract, the 
provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the life settlement 
contract and represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the life 
settlement contract, that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the 
policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering into the life settlement contract freely and 
voluntarily, and for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the 
insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was 
diagnosed after the policy was issued.(d) The insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting 
change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in this 
state or with a resident of this state.(e) If a settlement broker or life insurance producer performs 
any of these activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the 
requirements of this section.(f) If a broker performs those verification-of-coverage activities 
required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of § 23-81-
809(a).(g) Within twenty (20) days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the 
provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy 
has become subject to a life settlement contract.(h) All medical information solicited or obtained 
by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provision of state law relating to confidentiality 
of medical information, if not otherwise provided in this subchapter.(i)(1) All life settlement 
contracts entered into in this state shall provide that the owner may rescind the contract on or 
before fifteen (15) days after the date it is executed by all parties to the life settlement 
contract.(2) Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the 
rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest 
paid on account of the provider within the rescission period.(3) If the insured dies during the 
rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment by 
the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the 
provider.(j)(1) Within three (3) business days after receipt from the owner of documents to effect 
the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement to an 
escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally chartered 
financial institution pending acknowledgement of the transfer by the issuer of the policy.(2) The 
trustee or escrow agent shall transfer the proceeds due to the owner within three (3) business 
days of acknowledgement of the transfer from the insurer.(k)(1) Failure to tender the life 
settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner renders the life 
settlement contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the proceeds are 
tendered to and accepted by the owner.(2) A failure to give written notice of the right of 
rescission hereunder shall toll the right of rescission until thirty (30) days after the written notice 
of the right of rescission has been given.(l)(1) Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual, or an 

owner to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement 
contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the 
policy.(2) This section does not prohibit a broker from reducing the broker's fee below this 
percentage if the broker so chooses.(m) The broker shall disclose to the owner anything of value 
paid or given to a broker that relates to a life settlement contract.(n) At any time prior to or at the 
time of the application for or issuance of a policy or during a two-year period commencing with 
the date of issuance of the policy, a person shall not enter into a life settlement contract 
regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the 
assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest, or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition 
does not apply if the owner certifies to the provider that:(1)(A) The policy was issued upon the 
owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided the 
total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy 
is at least twenty-four (24) months.(B) The time covered under a group policy shall be calculated 
without regard to a change in insurance carriers, provided the coverage has been continuous and 
under the same group sponsorship; or(2) The owner submits independent evidence to the 
provider that one (1) or more of the following conditions have been met within the two-year 
period:(A) The owner or insured is terminally or chronically ill;(B) The owner or insured 
disposes of his or her ownership interests in a closely held corporation pursuant to the terms of a 
buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially 
issued;(C) The owner's spouse dies;(D) The owner divorces his or her spouse;(E) The owner 
retires from full-time employment;(F) The owner becomes physically or mentally disabled and a 
physician determines that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time 
employment; or(G) A final order, judgment, or decree is entered by a court of competent 
jurisdiction on the application of a creditor of the owner adjudicating the owner bankrupt or 
insolvent or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, 
trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's assets.(3)(A) Copies of the 
independent evidence required by subdivision (n)(2) of this section shall be submitted to the 
insurer when the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage.(B) The 
copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the copies are true 
and correct copies of the documents received by the provider.(C) This section does not prohibit 
an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any policy.(4) If the provider 
submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided in subdivision (n)(2)(A) of this 
section when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to 
the provider, the copy is deemed to establish that the life settlement contract satisfies the 
requirements of this section.

Section 23-81-812 - Authority to promulgate rules - Conflict of laws(a) The Insurance 
Commissioner may promulgate rules implementing this subchapter regulating the activities and 
relationships of providers, brokers, insurers, and their agents, subject to statutory limitations on 
administrative rulemaking.(b) CONFLICT OF LAWS.(1)(A) If there is more than one (1) owner 
on a single policy and the owners are residents of different states, the life settlement contract 
shall be governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest percentage 
ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of one (1) owner 
agreed upon in writing by all of the owners.(B) The law of the state of the insured shall govern if 
equal owners fail to agree in writing upon a state of residence for jurisdictional 

purposes.(2)(A) A provider from this state who enters into a life settlement contract with an 
owner who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted regulations 
governing life settlement contracts shall be governed in the effectuation of that life settlement 
contract by the statutes and regulations of the owner's state of residence.(B) If the state in which 
the owner is a resident has not enacted statutes or regulations governing life settlement contracts, 
the provider shall give the owner notice that neither state regulates the transaction upon which he 
or she is entering.(C) For transactions in those states, however, the provider shall maintain all 
records required if the transactions were executed in the state of residence. The forms used in 
those states need not be approved by the State Insurance Department.(3) If there is a conflict in 
the laws that apply to an owner and a purchaser in any individual transaction, the laws of the 
state that apply to the owner shall take precedence, and the provider shall comply with those 
laws. 
Ark. Code § 23-81-812 
Section 23-81-813 - Prohibited practices(a) It is unlawful for any person to:(1) Enter into a life 
settlement contract if the person knows or reasonably should have known that the life insurance

policy;(2) Engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business if the person knows or 
reasonably should have known that the intent was to avoid the notice requirements of this 
section;(3) Engage in any fraudulent act or practice in connection with any transaction relating to 
any settlement involving an owner who is a resident of this state;(4) Issue, solicit, market, or 
otherwise promote the purchase of an insurance policy for the purpose of or with an emphasis on

proceeds, fees, or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from the policy or owner of the 
policy or any other person with respect to the premium finance agreement or any settlement 
contract or other transaction related to the policy that are in addition to the amounts required to 
pay the principal, interest, and service charges related to policy premiums pursuant to the 
premium finance agreement or subsequent sale of the agreement.(B) Any payments, charges, 
fees, or other amounts in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest, and 
service charges related to policy premiums paid under the premium finance agreement shall be 
remitted to the original owner of the policy or to his or her estate if he or she is not living at the 
time of the determination of the overpayment;(6) With respect to any life settlement contract or 
insurance policy and a broker, knowingly solicit an offer from, effectuate a life settlement 
contract with, or make a sale to any provider, financing entity, or related provider trust that is 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the broker;(7) With respect to any life 
settlement contract or insurance policy and a provider, knowingly enter into a life settlement

be paid to a broker that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the provider 
or the financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in the life settlement 
contract;(8)(A) With respect to a provider, enter into a life settlement contract unless the life 
settlement contract promotional, advertising, and marketing materials, as may be prescribed by 
rule, have been filed with the Insurance Commissioner.(B) Marketing materials shall not 
expressly reference that the insurance is free for any period of time.(C) The inclusion of any 
reference in the marketing materials that would cause an owner to reasonably believe that the 
insurance is free for any period of time is a violation of this subchapter; or(9) With respect to any 

life insurance producer, insurance company, broker, or provider, make any statement or 
representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life 
insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any 
period of time unless provided in the policy.(b) A violation of this section is a fraudulent life 
settlement act.

OF FRAUDULENT LIFE SETTLEMENT ACT.(1) Any person engaged in the business of life 
settlements having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, 
will be, or has been committed shall provide to the Insurance Commissioner the information

against a person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent life
