management of or owns a pecuniary interest in any person subject to examination; provided, 
however, that an examiner may be: (i) an owner; (ii) an insured in a life settlement contract or 
insurance policy; or (iii)a beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed for a life settlement 
contract.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, the commissioner may retain 
from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants or 
other similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions, even though such 
persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to 
examination under sections 213 to 223E, inclusive.(i)(1) No cause of action shall arise and no 
liability shall be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized 
representatives or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for statements made or conduct

shall arise and no liability shall be imposed against a person for communicating or delivering 
information or data to the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized representative or an 
examiner related to an examination if the communication or delivery was performed in good 
faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive. Nothing in this paragraph shall 
abrogate or modify any common law or statutory privilege or immunity enjoyed by any person 
referenced in paragraph (1).(3) A person referenced in paragraph (1) or (2) shall be entitled to an 
award of attorneys' fees and costs if that person is the prevailing party in a civil action for libel,

Section 175:221 - Financing as collateral; causes for rejection(a) Insurance carriers may inquire 
in the application for insurance whether the proposed owner intends to pay premiums with the 
assistance of financing from a lender that will use the policy as collateral to support the 
financing.(b) If the premium finance loan provides funds which can be used for a purpose other 
than paying for the premiums, costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the 
life insurance policy and loan, the application shall be rejected as a violation of this 
chapter.(c) The insurance carrier may disclose certain information to the applicant and the 
insured, either on the application or an amendment to the application to be completed not later 
than the delivery of the policy including, but not limited to, the following disclosure: "If you 
have entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral and the policy 
changes ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the following may be 
true: (1) a change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's 
life;(2) a change of ownership could, in the future, limit your ability to purchase future insurance 
on the insured's life because there is a limit on the amount of coverage insurers will issue on 1 
life;(3) should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage 
on the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status and 
other factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage or may result in significantly higher 

premiums;(4) you should consult a professional tax advisor, since a change in ownership in 
satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure 
of the loan."(d) The insurance carrier may require certifications from the applicant or the 
insured, including the following certified statements: (1) I have not entered into any agreement 
or arrangement providing for the future sale of this life insurance policy;(2) My loan 
arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for some or all of the premiums, 
costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining my life insurance policy; however, 
I have not entered into any agreement by which I am to receive consideration in exchange for 
procuring this policy; and(3) The borrower has an insurable interest in the insured. 
Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 221 
Section 175:222 - Entering into life settlement contract where insured has terminal or chronic 
illness(a) A life settlement provider entering into a life settlement contract with an owner of a 
policy, where the insured has a terminal or chronic illness or condition, shall first obtain: (1) if 
the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner 
is of sound mind; and(2) a document in which the insured consents to the release of the insured's 
medical records to a life settlement provider, life settlement broker or insurance producer and, if 
the policy was issued less than 2 years from the date of application for a life settlement contract, 
to the insurance company that issued the policy.(b) Within 20 days after an owner executes the 
life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that 
issued the insurance policy that the policy has become subject to a life settlement contract. The 
notice shall be accompanied by the documents required in clauses (1) and (2) of subsection 
(a).(c) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a life 
settlement provider, life settlement broker or life insurance producer not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date the request was received. The request for verification of coverage shall be 
made on a form approved by the commissioner. The insurer shall complete and issue the 
verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In its response, the 
insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the 
insurer intends to pursue an investigation regarding the validity of the insurance 
contract.(d) Prior to or at the time of execution of the life settlement contract, the life settlement 
provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner: (1) consents to the life 
settlement contract; (2)represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the life 
settlement contract; (3)represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the 
benefits of the policy;(4)acknowledges that the owner is entering into the life settlement contract 
freely and voluntarily; and (5) for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, 
acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness or condition and that the terminal 
or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.(e) The insurer shall not 
unreasonably delay effecting a change of ownership or beneficiary with a life settlement contract 
lawfully entered into in the commonwealth or with a resident of the commonwealth.(f) If a life 
settlement broker or life insurance producer performs any of the activities in subsections (a) and 
(b) or (d), the life settlement provider shall be deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this 
section.(g) If a life settlement broker performs those verification of coverage activities required 
of the life settlement provider, the life settlement provider shall be deemed to have fulfilled the 
requirements of this section.(h) All medical information solicited or obtained by a licensee shall 
be subject to applicable provisions of this chapter and any other law relating to the 
confidentiality of medical information, if not otherwise provided in sections 213 to 223E, 

inclusive.(i) A life settlement contract shall provide that the owner may rescind the life 
settlement contract not more than 15 days after the date it was executed by all parties. 
Rescission, if exercised by the owner, shall be effective only if: (1) notice of the rescission is 
given and (2) the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid on 
account of the life settlement provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the 
rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to 
repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan 
interest to the life settlement provider. Failure to give written notice of the right of rescission 
shall toll the right of rescission until 30 days after the written notice of the right of rescission has 
been given.(j) Within 3 business days after receipt from the owner of documents to effect the 
transfer of the policy pursuant to a life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall pay 
the proceeds of the life settlement contract to an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or 
escrow agent in a state or federally-chartered financial institution pending acknowledgement of 
the transfer by the issuer of the policy. The trustee or escrow agent shall transfer the proceeds 
due to the owner within 3 business days of acknowledgement of the transfer from the 
insurer.(k) Failure to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date 
disclosed to the owner renders the life settlement contract voidable by the owner for lack of 
consideration until such time as the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner.(l) Any 
fee paid by a life settlement provider, party, individual or from an owner to a life settlement 
broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract 
shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the policy. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to prohibit a life settlement broker from reducing the life 
settlement broker's fee below this percentage if the broker so chooses.(m) No person at any time 
prior to, or at the time of the application for, or issuance of a policy, or during a 2-year period 
commencing with the date of issuance of the policy shall enter into a life settlement contract 
regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the 
assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest or surrender of the policy is to occur.(n)(1) The 
prohibition in subsection (m) shall not apply if: (i) the owner certifies to the provider that the 
policy was issued upon the owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or 
individual policy; provided, however, that the total of the time covered under the conversion 
policy plus the time covered under the prior policy shall be at least 24 months; and provided 
further, that the time covered under a group policy shall be calculated without regard to a change 
in insurance carriers, if the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship; 
or(ii) the owner submits independent evidence to the life settlement provider that any of the 
following conditions have been met within the 2-year period: (A) the owner or insured has a 
terminal or chronic illness or condition;(B) the owner or insured disposes of the owner's or 
insured's ownership interests in a closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or 
other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued;(C) the 
owner's spouse dies;(D) the owner obtains a divorce;(E) the owner retires from full-time 
employment;(F) the owner becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines 
that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment; or(G) a final 
order, judgment or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the application of a 
creditor of the owner adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition 
seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee or liquidator to all or a 
substantial part of the owner's assets;(2) Copies of the independent evidence required by clause 
(ii) of paragraph (1) shall be submitted to the insurer when the life settlement provider submits a 

request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of 
attestation from the life settlement provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the 
documents received by the life settlement provider. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an 
insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of a policy.(3) If the life settlement 
provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided for in subclause (A) of 
clause (ii) of paragraph (1) when the life settlement provider submits a request to the insurer to 
effect the transfer of the policy to the life settlement provider, the copy shall be deemed to 
establish that the life settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section. 
Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 222 
Section 175:223 - Life settlement contracts with residents from other states(a) If there is more 
than 1 owner on a single policy and the owners are residents of different states, the life 
settlement contract shall be governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the 
largest percentage of ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of 
residence of 1 owner agreed upon in writing by all of the owners. The law of the state of the 
insured shall govern in the event that equal owners fail to agree in writing upon a state of 
residence for jurisdictional purposes.(b) A life settlement provider from the commonwealth who 
enters into a life settlement contract with an owner who is a resident of another state that has 
enacted laws or adopted regulations governing life settlement contracts shall be governed in the 
effectuation of that life settlement contract by the laws and regulations of the owner's state of 
residence. If the state in which the owner is a resident has not enacted laws or regulations 
governing life settlement contracts, the life settlement provider shall give the owner notice that 
neither state regulates the transaction upon which the owner is entering. For transactions in those 
states, however, the life settlement provider shall maintain all records required if the transactions 
were executed in the owner's state of residence. The forms used in those states shall not require 
the approval of the commissioner.(c) If there is a conflict in the laws that apply to an owner and a 
purchaser in an individual transaction, the laws of the state that apply to the owner shall take 
precedence and the provider shall comply with those laws. 
Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 223

settlement act.(b) "Fraudulent life settlement act" shall mean: (1) an act or omission committed

otherwise deal in a life settlement contract, the subject of which is a life insurance policy that 
was obtained by presenting false information concerning any fact material to the policy or by 
concealing, for the purpose of misleading another, information requested concerning any fact 
material to the policy, where the owner or the owner's agent intended to defraud the policy's 
issuer;(vii) to attempt to commit, assist, aid or abet in the commission of, or conspiracy to

or a substantially similar statement:  
"Any person who knowingly presents false information in a life settlement application or 
contract may be found guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison." 
(2) The lack of a statement as required in paragraph (1) shall not constitute a defense in a 
prosecution for a fraudulent life settlement act.(c)(1) A person engaged in the business of life 
settlements having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, 
will be or has been committed shall provide to the commissioner the information required by,
