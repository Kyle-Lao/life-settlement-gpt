Section 626.9922 โ Examination 
(1) The office or department may examine the business and affairs of any of its respective licensees 
or applicants for a license. The office or department may order any such licensee or applicant to 
produce any records, books, files, advertising and solicitation materials, or other information and 
may take statements under oath to determine whether the licensee or applicant is in violation of the 
law or is acting contrary to the public interest. The expenses incurred in conducting any examination 
or investigation must be paid by the licensee or applicant. Examinations and investigations must be 
conducted as provided in chapter 624, and licensees are subject to all applicable provisions of the 
insurance code.(2) All accounts, books and records, documents, files, contracts, and other 
information relating to all transactions of viatical settlement contracts, life expectancies, or viatical 
settlement purchase agreements made before July 1, 2005, must be maintained by the licensee for a 
period of at least 3 years after the death of the insured and must be available to the office or 
department for inspection during reasonable business hours.(3) All such records or accurate copies 
of such records must be maintained at the licensee's home office. As used in this section, the term 
"home office" means the principal place of business and any other single storage facility, the street 
address of which shall be disclosed to the office or department within 20 days after its initial use, or 
within 20 days of the effective date of this subsection.(4) The originals of records required to be

Section 626.9923 - Viatical settlement contracts; required disclosures 
The viatical settlement broker, or the viatical settlement provider in transactions in which no broker 
is used, must inform the viator by the date of application for a viatical settlement contract: 
(1) That there are possible alternatives to viatical settlement contracts for persons who have a 
catastrophic or life-threatening illness, including, but not limited to, accelerated benefits offered by 
the issuer of a life insurance policy.(2) That proceeds of the viatical settlement could be taxable, and 
assistance should be sought from a personal tax advisor.(3) That viatical settlement proceeds could 
be subject to the claims of creditors.(4) That receipt of viatical settlement proceeds could adversely 
affect the recipient's eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits or entitlements, and advice 
should be obtained from the appropriate agencies.(5) That all viatical settlement contracts entered 
into in this state must contain an unconditional rescission provision which allows the viator to 
rescind the contract within 15 days after the viator receives the viatical settlement proceeds, 
conditioned on the return of such proceeds.(6) The name, business address, and telephone number 
of the independent third-party escrow agent, and the fact that the viator may inspect or receive 
copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents. 
Fla. Stat. ยง 626.9923 
 
Section 626.9924 - Viatical settlement contracts; procedures; rescission 
(1) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical settlement contract with any viator must first 
obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, 
represents that he or she has a full and complete understanding of the viatical settlement contract 
and the benefits of the life insurance policy, releases his or her medical records, and acknowledges 
that he or she has entered into the viatical settlement contract freely and voluntarily.(2) All viatical 
settlement contracts subject to this act must contain an unconditional rescission provision which 
allows the viator to rescind the contract within 15 days after the viator receives the viatical 
settlement proceeds, conditioned on the return of such proceeds.(3) A viatical settlement 
transaction may be completed only through the use of an independent third-party trustee or escrow 
agent. Immediately upon receipt by the independent third-party trustee or escrow agent of 
documents from the viator to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the viatical settlement 
provider must pay the proceeds of the settlement to an escrow or trust account managed by the 
independent third-party trustee or escrow agent in a financial institution licensed under Florida law 
or a federally chartered financial institution that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, pending 
acknowledgment of the transfer by the issuer of the policy. An advance or partial payment of the 
proceeds due under a viatical settlement contract may not be used to effect transfer of the subject 
policy; any such advance or partial payment is made at the sole discretion and risk of the viatical 
settlement provider.(4) Upon receipt of all viatical settlement contract proceeds, the independent 
third-party trustee or escrow agent must release to the viatical settlement provider all documents 

necessary to complete the transfer of the insurance policy or certificate of insurance so that the 
transfer, assignment, sale, bequest, or devise may be effected.(5) The independent third-party 
trustee or escrow agent must transfer all proceeds of the viatical settlement contract within 3 
business days after receiving from the issuer of the subject policy acknowledgment of the transfer, 
assignment, bequest, sale, or devise. Failure to transfer proceeds as required by this subsection 
renders the viatical settlement contract and the transfer, assignment, bequest, sale, or devise 
voidable.(6) A viatical settlement provider may not negotiate or enter into a viatical settlement 
contract with a viator if the subject policy contains an accelerated benefits provision allowing 
benefits to be paid for a period in advance of the expected death which is equal to or exceeds the 
time period available under the viatical settlement contract, and at an amount which is equal to or 
exceeds the amount available under the viatical settlement contract, unless the issuer of the policy, 
in writing, denies, declines, or refuses to provide such accelerated benefits. If the insurer does not 
respond to a request to effectuate an accelerated benefits provision sent by certified mail within 30 
days after receiving the request, the insurer shall be deemed to have denied, declined, or refused to 
provide such accelerated benefits.(7) At any time during the contestable period, within 20 days after 
a viator executes documents necessary to transfer rights under an insurance policy or within 20 days 
of any agreement, option, promise, or any other form of understanding, express or implied, to 
viaticate the policy, the provider must give notice to the insurer of the policy that the policy has or 
will become a viaticated policy. The notice must be accompanied by the documents required by 
s. 626.99287.(8) If the owner of the insurance policy is not the insured, the provider shall notify the 
insured that the policy has become the subject of a viatical settlement contract within 20 days after 
the transfer of rights under the contract.(9) If the provider transfers ownership or changes the 
beneficiary of the insurance policy, the provider must communicate the initial change in ownership 
or beneficiary to the insured within 20 days after the change.(10) The viatical settlement provider 
who effectuated the viatical settlement contract with the viator (the "initial provider") is responsible 
for tracking the insured, including, but not limited to, keeping track of the insured's whereabouts and 
health status, submission of death claims or assisting the beneficiary in the submission of death 
claims, and the status of the payment of premiums until the death of the insured. This responsibility 
may be contracted out to a third party; however, the ultimate responsibility remains with the initial 
provider. This responsibility continues with the initial provider, notwithstanding any transfers of the 
viaticated policy in the secondary market. This subsection applies only to those viaticated policies 
that are or are to become the subject of viatical settlement purchase agreements.

Section 626.99245 - Conflict of regulation of viaticals 
(1) A viatical settlement provider who from this state enters into a viatical settlement contract with a 
viator who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted regulations governing 
viatical settlement contracts shall be governed in the effectuation of that viatical settlement 
contract by the statutes and regulations of the viator's state of residence. If the state in which the 
viator is a resident has not enacted statutes or regulations governing viatical settlement agreements, 
the provider shall give the viator notice that neither Florida nor his or her state regulates the 
transaction upon which he or she is entering. For transactions in those states, however, the viatical 
settlement provider is to maintain all records required as if the transactions were executed in 
Florida. The forms used in those states need not be approved by the office.(2) This section does not 

affect the requirement of ss. 626.9911(14) and 626.9912(1) that a viatical settlement provider doing 
business from this state must obtain a viatical settlement license from the office. As used in this

Section 626.9927 - Unfair trade practices; cease and desist; injunctions; civil remedy 
(1) A violation of this act is an unfair trade practice under ss. 626.9521 and 626.9541 and is subject 
to the penalties provided in the insurance code. Part IX of this chapter, entitled Unfair Insurance 
Trade Practices, applies to a licensee under this act or a transaction subject to this act as if a viatical 
settlement contract were an insurance policy.(2) In addition to the penalties and other enforcement 
provisions of this act, if any person violates this act or any rule implementing this act, the office or 
department, as appropriate, may seek an injunction in the circuit court of the county where the 
person resides or has a principal place of business and may apply for temporary and permanent 
orders that the office or department determines necessary to restrain the person from committing 
the violation.(3) Any person damaged by the acts of a person in violation of this act may bring a civil 
action against the person committing the violation in the circuit court of the county in which the 
alleged violator resides or has a principal place of business or in the county wherein the alleged 
violation occurred. Upon an adverse adjudication, the defendant is liable for damages, together with 
court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff. When so awarded, court costs 
and attorney's fees must be included in the judgment or decree rendered in the case. If it appears to 
the court that the suit brought by the plaintiff is frivolous or brought for purposes of harassment, the 
plaintiff is liable for court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the defendant.

Section 626.99272 - Cease and desist orders and fines 

(1) The office or department as appropriate may issue a cease and desist order upon a person that 
violates any provision of this part, any rule or order adopted by the commission, office, or 
department, or any written agreement entered into with the office or department.(2) When the office 
or department finds that such an action presents an immediate danger to the public which requires 
an immediate final order, it may issue an emergency cease and desist order reciting with 
particularity the facts underlying such findings. The emergency cease and desist order is effective 
immediately upon service of a copy of the order on the respondent and remains effective for 90 
days. If the office or department begins nonemergency cease and desist proceedings under 
subsection (1), the emergency cease and desist order remains effective, absent an order by an 
appellate court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to s. 120.68, until the conclusion of proceedings 
under ss. 120.569 and 120.57.(3) The office or department may impose and collect an administrative 
fine not to exceed $10,000 for each nonwillful violation and $25,000 for each willful violation of any 
provision of this part.
