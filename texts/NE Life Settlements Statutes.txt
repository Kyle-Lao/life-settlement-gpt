Section 44-1107 - Examination; investigation(1)(a) The director may conduct an examination of

of independent certified public accountants, and other relevant criteria as determined by the

may examine or investigate any person or the business of any person, insofar as the examination 
or investigation is, in the sole discretion of the director, necessary or material to the examination 
of the licensee.(c) In lieu of an examination under the act of any foreign or alien licensee 
licensed in this state, the director may, in his or her sole discretion, accept an examination report 
on the licensee as prepared by the director for the licensee's state of domicile or port-of-entry 
state.(d) As far as is practical, the examination of a foreign or alien licensee shall be made in 
cooperation with the insurance regulatory officials of other states in which the licensee transacts 
business.(2)(a) A person required to be licensed under the act shall for five years retain copies of 
all:(i) Proposed, offered, or executed contracts, purchase agreements, underwriting documents,

retained by this section must be legible and complete and may be retained in paper, photograph, 
microprocess, magnetic, mechanical, or electronic media or by any process that accurately 
reproduces or forms a durable medium for the reproduction of a record.(3)(a) Upon determining 
that an examination should be conducted, the director shall appoint one or more examiners to 
perform the examination and instruct them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the 
examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the 
Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The 
director may also employ such other guidelines or procedures as he or she deems 
appropriate.(b) Every licensee or person from whom information is sought and its officers, 
directors, employees, and agents shall provide to the examiner timely, convenient, and free 
access at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, 
assets, and computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of 
the licensee being examined. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or 
person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to 
do so. The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to 
examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the director shall be grounds for 
the suspension, refusal, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage 
in the viatical settlement business or other business subject to the director's jurisdiction. Any 

proceedings for the suspension, revocation, or refusal of any license or authority shall be 
conducted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.(c) The director may issue subpoenas, 
administer oaths, and examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the 
examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the director may 
petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order 
compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey 
the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court. A person who is subpoenaed shall 
attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena anywhere within the state. He or she 
shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in the district court, with 
mileage to be computed at the rate provided in section 81-1176, which fees, mileage, and actual 
expense, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the attendance of witnesses, and their testimony, 
shall be itemized, charged against, and paid by the licensee being examined.(d) When making an 
examination under the Viatical Settlements Act, the director may retain attorneys, appraisers, 
independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and 
specialists as examiners, the cost of which will be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the 
examination.(e) Nothing contained in the act shall be construed to limit the director's authority to 
terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant 
to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions of law made pursuant to any 
examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(f) Nothing contained 
in the act shall be construed to limit the director's authority to use, and, if appropriate, to make 
public, any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee workpapers or 
other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any 
examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the director may, in his or 
her sole discretion, deem appropriate.(4)(a) Examination reports shall be comprised of only facts 
appearing upon the books, records, or other documents of the licensee or its agents or other 
persons examined, or as ascertained from the testimony of its officers or agents or other persons 
examined concerning its affairs, and such conclusions and recommendations as the examiners 
find reasonably warranted from the facts.(b) No later than forty-five days following completion 
of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the director a verified written report of 
examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified report, the director shall transmit the report 
to the licensee examined, together with a notice that shall afford the licensee examined a 
reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty days to make a written submission or rebuttal with 
respect to any matters contained in the examination report.(c) Within thirty days after the end of 
the period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the director shall fully 
consider and review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any 
relevant portions of the examiner's workpapers, and shall:(i) Adopt the examination report as 
submitted or with modifications or corrections. If the examination report reveals that the licensee 
is operating in violation of any law, rule, regulation, or prior order of the director, the director 
may order the licensee to take any action the director considers necessary and appropriate to cure 
such violation; or(ii) Reject the examination report with directions to the examiner to reopen the 
examination for purposes of obtaining additional data, documentation, or information and to 
resubmit a report pursuant to subdivision (4)(b) of this section.(d) Any licensee aggrieved by any 
action of the director pursuant to subdivision (4)(c) of this section may, within ten days after 
such action, make written request to the director for a hearing. Upon receipt of the licensee's 
request for a hearing, the director shall provide notice of the hearing no less than ten nor more 
than thirty days after the date of the licensee's request. The notice shall identify the subject of the 

hearing and the specific issues.(e) Any hearing on an examination report shall be held in 
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.(f) The examination report, with any 
modifications and corrections thereof, shall be accepted by the director and filed for public 
inspection immediately after the expiration of the times specified in subdivision (4)(d) of this 
section in the event that the licensee has not requested a hearing. Within thirty days after the 
filing of the examination report for public inspection, the licensee shall file affidavits executed 
by each of its directors stating under oath that they have received a copy of the examination 
report and related orders.(5)(a) Names and individual identification data for all viators shall be 
considered private and confidential information and shall not be disclosed by the director unless 
required by law.(b) Except as otherwise provided in the Viatical Settlements Act, all 
examination reports, working papers, recorded information, documents, and copies thereof 
produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the director or any other person in the course of an 
examination made under the act, or in the course of analysis or investigation by the director of 
the financial condition or market conduct of a licensee, shall be confidential by law and 
privileged, shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to sections 84-712 to 84-712.09, shall not 
be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any 
private civil action. The director is authorized to use the documents, materials, communications, 
or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the 
director's official duties.(c) Documents, materials, communications, or other information, 
including all working papers and copies thereof, in the possession or control of the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries shall be confidential 
by law and privileged, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or 
admissible in evidence in any private civil action if they are:(i) Created, produced, or obtained by 
or disclosed to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates and 
subsidiaries in the course of assisting an examination made under the act or the law of another 
state or jurisdiction that is substantially similar to the act or assisting the director or the chief 
insurance regulatory official of another state in the analysis or investigation of the financial 
condition or market conduct of a licensee; or(ii) Disclosed to the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries under subdivision (e) of this 
subsection by the director or the chief insurance regulatory official of another state.(d) Neither 
the director nor any person that received the documents, materials, communications, or other 
information while acting under the authority of the director, including the National Association 
of Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries, shall be permitted to testify in any 
private civil action concerning any confidential documents, materials, communications, or other 
information subject to this subsection.(e) In order to assist in the performance of his or her 
duties, the director:(i) May share documents, materials, communications, or other information, 
including the confidential and privileged documents, materials, communications, or other 
information subject to this subsection, with other state, federal, foreign, and international 
regulatory agencies, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates 
and subsidiaries, and with state, federal, foreign, and international law enforcement authorities, if 
the recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the documents, 
materials, communications, or other information;(ii) May receive documents, materials, 
communications, or other information, including otherwise confidential and privileged 
documents, materials, communications, or other information, from the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and from regulatory and law 
enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as 

confidential or privileged any documents, materials, communications, or other information 
received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of 
the jurisdiction that is the source of the documents, materials, communications, or other 
information; and(iii) May enter into agreements governing sharing and use of information 
consistent with this subsection.(f) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of 
confidentiality in the documents, materials, communications, or other information shall occur as 
a result of disclosure to the director under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in 
subdivision (e) of this subsection.(g) A privilege established under the law of any state or 
jurisdiction that is substantially similar to the privilege established under this subsection shall be 
available and enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this state.(h) Nothing contained 
in the act shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the director from disclosing the content of 
an examination report, preliminary report or results, or any matter relating thereto to the director 
or chief insurance regulatory official of any other state or country, to any law enforcement 
official of this state or any other state, to any agency of the federal government at any time, or to 
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners so long as the agency or office receiving 
the examination report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold the examination report 
or matters confidential and in a manner consistent with the act.(6)(a) An examiner may not be 
appointed by the director if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or 
is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary interest in any person subject to 
examination under the Viatical Settlements Act. This subsection shall not be construed to 
automatically preclude an examiner from being:(i) A viator;(ii) An insured in a viaticated 
insurance policy; or(iii) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed to be 
viaticated.(b) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, the director may retain from 
time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants, or other 
similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions, even though these persons 
may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination 
under the act.(7) The reasonable expenses of the examination of a licensee conducted under the 
Viatical Settlements Act shall be fixed and determined by the director who shall collect the same 
from the licensee examined. The licensee shall reimburse the amount thereof upon presentation 
of a statement by the director. Reimbursement shall be limited to a reasonable allocation for the 
salary of each examiner plus actual expenses. All money collected by the director for 
examination of licensees shall be remitted in accordance with section 44-116.(8)(a) No cause of 
action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against the director, the director's authorized 
representatives, or any examiner appointed by the director for any statements made or conduct 
performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of the Viatical Settlements Act.(b) No 
cause of action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of 
communicating or delivering information or data to the director or the director's authorized 
representative or an examiner pursuant to an examination made under the act, if the act of 
communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the 
intent to deceive. This subdivision does not abrogate or modify in any way common-law or 
statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in this 
subsection.(c) A person identified in this subsection is entitled to an award of attorney's fees and 
costs if he or she is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander, or any other 
relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of the Viatical Settlements Act 
and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this 
section, a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the 

time that it was initiated.(9) The director may investigate suspected fraudulent viatical settlement 
acts and persons engaged in the business of viatical settlements. 
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1107

viatical settlement, a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall provide the 
viator with at least the disclosures required by this section no later than the time the application 
for the viatical settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be provided in a 
separate document that is signed by the viator and the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker and shall provide the following information:(a) Possible alternatives to viatical 
settlement contracts, including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the 
viator's life insurance policy;(b) Some or all of the proceeds of the viatical settlement may be 
taxable under federal income tax laws and state franchise and income tax laws, and assistance

adversely effect the viator's eligibility for medicaid or other government benefits or entitlements, 
and advice should be obtained from the appropriate government agencies;(e) A viatical 
settlement broker represents exclusively the viator, not the insurer or the viatical settlement 
provider, and owes a fiduciary duty to the viator, including a duty to act according to the viator's 
instructions and in the best interest of the viator;(f) The viator has the right to rescind the viatical 
settlement contract before the earlier of sixty calendar days after the date on which the viatical 
settlement contract is executed by all parties or thirty calendar days after the viatical settlement 
proceeds have been paid to the viator as provided in subsection (3) of section 44-1109. 
Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given 
and the viator repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid on account of 
the viatical settlement within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission 
period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded by the viator or 
the viator's estate. If a viatical settlement contract is rescinded, all viatical settlement proceeds 
and any premiums paid by the viatical settlement provider or purchaser shall be repaid to the 
viatical settlement provider or purchaser within sixty days of such rescission;(g) Funds will be

insurer or group administrator's written acknowledgment that the ownership of the policy or 
interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been 
designated;(h) Entering into a viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, 
including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits, that may exist under the policy or 
certificate to be forfeited by the viator, and assistance should be sought from a financial 
advisor;(i) A brochure describing the process of viatical settlements. The National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners' form for the brochure shall be used unless one is developed by the 
director; and(j) Following the execution of a viatical settlement contract, the insured may be 
contacted for the purpose of determining the insured's health status and to confirm the insured's 
residential or business street address and telephone number, or as otherwise provided under the 
Viatical Settlements Act. This contact is limited to once every six months if the insured has a life 
expectancy of more than one year, and no more than once every three months if the insured has a 
life expectancy of one year or less. All such contacts shall be made only by a viatical settlement 
provider licensed in the state in which the viator resided at the time of the viatical settlement or 
by the authorized representative of the viatical settlement provider. 

The disclosure document shall contain the following language: All medical, financial, or 
personal information solicited or obtained by a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement 
broker about you, the insured, including your identity or the identity of family members, a 
spouse, or a significant other, may be disclosed as necessary to effect the viatical settlement 
between the viator and the viatical settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this 
information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to 
someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew 
your permission to share information every two years. 
(2) A viatical settlement provider shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures

purchaser;(d) If an insurance policy to be viaticated has been issued as a joint policy or involves 
family riders or any coverage of a life other than the insured under the policy to be viaticated, 
there is the possibility of a loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy, and consultation 
with an insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice on the proposed viatical 
settlement is advised;(e) The dollar amount of the current death benefit payable to the viatical 
settlement provider under the policy or certificate and, if known, the availability of any 
additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar amount of any accidental death and 
dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate, and the extent to which the viator's 
interest in those benefits will be transferred as a result of the viatical settlement contract; 
and(f) Whether the funds will be escrowed with an independent third party during the transfer 
process, and if so, provide the name, business address, and telephone number of the independent 
third-party escrow agent. The viator or owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant 
escrow or trust agreements or documents.(3) A viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator 
with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the viatical settlement contract is 
signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in the viatical settlement 
contract or in a separate document signed by the viator and provide the following 
information:(a) The name, business address, and telephone number of the viatical settlement

affiliations or contractual arrangements between the viatical settlement broker and any person 
making an offer in connection with the proposed viatical settlement contracts;(d) The amount 
and method of calculating the viatical settlement broker's compensation. Compensation includes 
anything of value paid or given to a viatical settlement broker for the placement of a policy;

viatical settlement offer, the viatical settlement broker shall disclose the total amount of the 
viatical settlement offer and the percentage of the viatical settlement offer comprised by the 
viatical settlement broker's compensation.(4) If the viatical settlement provider transfers 
ownership or changes the beneficiary of the insurance policy, the provider shall communicate in 
writing the change in ownership or beneficiary to the insured within twenty days after the 
change. 

Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1108 
Section 44-1108.01 - Viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider; disclosure 
Before the initiation of a plan, transaction, or series of transactions, a viatical settlement broker 
or viatical settlement provider shall fully disclose to an insurer a plan, transaction, or series of 
transactions to which the viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider is a party, to 
originate, renew, continue, or finance a life insurance policy with the insurer for the purpose of 
engaging in the business of viatical settlements at anytime prior to or during the first five years 
after issuance of the policy. 
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1108.01 
Section 44-1109 - Viatical settlement contract requirements(1)(a) A viatical settlement provider 
entering into a viatical settlement contract shall first obtain:(i) If the viator is the insured, a 
written statement from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under 
no constraint or undue influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract; and(ii) A document 
in which the insured consents, as required in subsection (2) of section 44-1106, to the release of 
his or her medical records to a viatical settlement provider, a viatical settlement broker, and the 
insurance company that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the 
insured.(b) Within twenty days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights 
under an insurance policy, or within twenty days after entering any agreement, option, promise, 
or other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical 
settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that 
the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. The notice must be accompanied by the 
documents required by subdivision (c) of this subsection.(c) The viatical settlement provider 
shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under subdivision (a)(ii) of this subsection, a 
copy of the viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice required under 
subdivision (b) of this subsection, and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that 
issued the life insurance policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners' form for verification of coverage shall be used unless 
another form is developed and approved by the director.(d) The insurer shall respond to a request 
for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or 
viatical settlement broker within thirty calendar days after the date the request is received and 
shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer 
intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or 
possible fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on a National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners' form or any other form approved by the director. The 
insurer shall accept an original, facsimile, or electronic copy of such request and any 
accompanying authorization signed by the viator. Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations 
under this subsection shall be a violation of subsection (3) of section 44-1110 and section 44-
1115.(e) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical 
settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical 
settlement contract and represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the 
viatical settlement contract, that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the benefits 
of the life insurance policy, that the viator acknowledges he or she is entering into the viatical 
settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or 

condition, that the viator acknowledges the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and the 
terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was 
issued.(f) If a viatical settlement broker performs any of the activities listed in this subsection on 
behalf of the viatical settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the 
requirements of this section.(2) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee 
shall be subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to confidentiality of medical 
information.(3) All viatical settlement contracts entered into in this state shall provide the viator 
with an absolute right to rescind the contract before the earlier of sixty calendar days after the 
date on which the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or thirty calendar days 
after the viatical settlement proceeds have been sent to the viator as provided in subsection (5) of 
this section. Rescission by the viator may be conditioned on the viator both giving notice and 
repaying to the viatical settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the 
settlement and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical 
settlement provider in connection with or as a consequence of the viatical settlement. If the 
insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have 
been rescinded. If a viatical settlement contract is rescinded, all viatical settlement proceeds and 
any premiums, loans, and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or 
purchaser shall be repaid to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser within sixty days of 
such rescission. In the event of any rescission, if the viatical settlement provider has paid 
commissions or other compensation to a viatical settlement broker in connection with the 
rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement broker shall refund all such commissions and 
compensation to the viatical settlement provider within five business days following receipt of a 
written demand from the viatical settlement provider, which demand shall be accompanied by 
either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the viator or notice of the 
death of the insured if rescinded by reason of death of the insured within the applicable 
rescission period.(4) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed 
documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary 
directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three business days after the date the escrow 
agent receives the documents or after the date the viatical settlement provider receives the 
documents if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, the provider 
shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement into an escrow or trust account 
maintained in a state-chartered or federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Upon payment of the settlement proceeds 
into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, 
assignment, or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider 
trust or other designated representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon the escrow 
agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, 
assignment, or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall 
pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.(5) Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the 
viatical settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to subdivision 
(1)(g) of section 44-1108 renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack 
of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds 
shall be deemed as sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow 
agent either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or sends a check for delivery to the 
viator by the United States Postal Service or other nationally recognized delivery 
service.(6) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the 

insured by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical 
settlement has occurred shall only be made by the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker licensed in this state or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to 
once every six months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year and to no more 
than once every three months for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less. The 
provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the viatical 
settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to 
any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. 
Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall be responsible for the actions 
of their authorized representatives. 
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1109 
Section 44-1110 - Prohibited acts(1) It is a violation of the Viatical Settlements Act for any 
person to enter into a viatical settlement contract at any time prior to the application or issuance 
of a policy which is the subject of a viatical settlement contract or within a five-year period 
commencing on the date of issuance of the insurance policy or certificate unless the viator 
certifies to the viatical settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions have 
been met within the five-year period:(a) The policy was issued upon the viator's exercise of 
conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy if the total of the time covered under 
the conversion policy, plus the time covered under the group or individual policy, is at least sixty 
months. The time covered under the group policy shall be calculated without regard to any 
change in insurance carriers if the coverage has been continuous and under the same group 
sponsorship;(b) The viator submits independent evidence to the viatical settlement provider that 
one or more of the following conditions have been met within the five-year period:(i) The viator 
or insured is terminally or chronically ill;(ii) The viator's spouse died;(iii) The viator divorced his 
or her spouse;(iv) The viator retired from full-time employment;(v) The viator became physically 
or mentally disabled and a physician determined that the disability prevented the viator from 
maintaining full-time employment; or(vi) A final order, judgment, or decree was entered by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the viator, adjudicating the 
viator bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the viator or 
appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator for all or a substantial part of the viator's assets; 
and(c) The viator enters into a viatical settlement contract more than two years after the date of 
issuance of a policy and, with respect to the policy, at all times prior to the date that is two years 
after policy issuance, the following conditions are met:(i) Policy premiums have been funded 
exclusively with unencumbered assets, including an interest in the life insurance policy being 
financed only to the extent of its net cash surrender value, provided by, or fully recourse liability 
incurred by, the insured or a person described in subdivision (15)(c)(v) of section 44-
1102;(ii) There is no agreement or understanding with any other person to guarantee any such 
liability or to purchase or stand ready to purchase the policy, including through an assumption or 
forgiveness of the loan; and(iii) Neither the insured nor the policy has been evaluated for 
settlement.(2) Copies of the independent evidence described in subdivision (1)(b) of this section 
and documents required by subsection (1) of section 44-1109 shall be submitted to the insurer 
when the viatical settlement provider or other party entering into a viatical settlement contract 
with a viator submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be 
accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement provider that the copies are 
true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical settlement provider.(3) If the 

viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner's or insured's certification 
and the independent evidence described in subdivision (1)(b) of this section when the provider 
submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy or certificate to the viatical 
settlement provider, the copy shall be deemed to conclusively establish that the viatical 
settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section and the insurer shall timely respond 
to the request.(4) No insurer may, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of 
coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a viatical settlement contract, require 
that the viator, insured, viatical settlement provider, or viatical settlement broker sign any forms, 
disclosures, consent, or waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the director for use 
in connection with viatical settlement contracts in this state.(5) Upon receipt of a properly 
completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in 
writing within thirty calendar days with written acknowledgment confirming that the change has 
been effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be processed. The 
insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary and shall not 
otherwise seek to interfere with any viatical settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state. 
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1110 
Section 44-1111 - Advertising for viatical settlements; guidelines and standards(1) The purpose 
of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous statements in the 
advertisement of viatical settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and adequate disclosure of 
the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of any viatical settlement contract. This purpose is 
intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and 
impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical settlements or related products or services to 
assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or 
misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of viatical 
settlements or related products or services through the advertising media and material used by 
licensees.(2) This section applies to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts or related 
products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including Internet advertising 
viewed by persons located in this state. If disclosure requirements are established pursuant to 
federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with 
federal regulation whenever possible.(3) Every licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a 
system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of 
its contracts, products, and services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, 
designed, or presented, shall be the responsibility of the licensee or licensees, as well as the 
individual who created or presented the advertisement. A system of control shall include regular 
routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the licensee who 
disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of 
any advertisement not furnished by the licensee.(4) Advertisements shall be truthful and not 
misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical 
settlement contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not 
have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity 
or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the director from the overall impression 
that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education 
or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(5)(a) The information 
required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented 
in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing 

or misleading.(b) An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, 
statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect 
of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, 
premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement 
contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is 
made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied, or that the viatical settlement contract 
includes a free look period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy 
misleading statements.(c) An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance 
company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the 
insurer.(d) An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death 
benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper 
practice.(e) The words free, no cost, without cost, no additional cost, or at no extra cost or words 
of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An 
advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is 
included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(f)(i) Any testimonial, appraisal, 
analysis, or endorsement used in an advertisement must be genuine, represent the current opinion 
of the author, be applicable to the viatical settlement contract, product, or service advertised, and 
be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving 
prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement. In using a testimonial, an appraisal, an analysis, or an endorsement, the licensee 
makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the 
provisions of this section.(ii) If the individual making a testimonial, an appraisal, an analysis, or 
an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, 
analysis, or endorsement either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, 
officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required 
union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(iii) An 
advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract benefit or service has 
been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals or any society, association, or other 
organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the 
viatical settlement provider is disclosed. If the entity making the approval or endorsement is 
owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlement provider, or receives any payment or 
other consideration from the viatical settlement provider for making an approval or endorsement, 
that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.(iv) When a testimonial, an appraisal, an 
analysis, or an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement contract, all 
pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its use.(v) An 
advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and 
relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified.(vi) An 
advertisement shall not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, viatical settlement 
brokers, viatical settlement investment agents, insurance producers, policies, services, or 
methods of marketing.(vii) The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be clearly identified 
in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract, products, or services, 
and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical settlement contract shall 
be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is 
part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be shown on the 
application.(viii) An advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the 
parent company of a licensee, name of a particular division of the licensee, service mark, slogan, 

symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the licensee if the 
advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity 
of the licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the licensee would have 
any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract.(ix) An 
advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by 
their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination 
of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise 
appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the 
solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.(x) An 
advertisement may state that a viatical settlement provider is licensed in the state where the 
advertisement appears if it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that competing 
viatical settlement providers may not be licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to 
consult the licensee's website or contact the department to find out if the state requires licensing 
and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider is licensed.(xi) An advertisement shall not 
create the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the 
payment of its claims, or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement 
contracts are recommended or endorsed by any government entity.(xii) The name of the licensee 
shall be stated in all of its advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any 
group designation, the name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, a service mark, 
a slogan, a symbol, or any other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to 
mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create the false impression that 
an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the 
licensee.(xiii) An advertisement shall not disclose or indirectly create the impression that any 
division or agency of the state or of the United States Government endorses, approves, or 
favors:(A) Any licensee or its business practices or methods of operation;(B) The merits, 
desirability, or advisability of any viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement 
program;(C) Any viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement program; or(D) Any life 
insurance policy or life insurance company.(xiv) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with 
which the viatication will occur, the advertising must disclose the average timeframe from 
completed application to the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds 
by the viator.(xv) If the advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the 
advertising shall disclose the average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by 
viators contracting with the licensee during the past six months. 
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1111 
Section 44-1112 - Fraud prevention and control(1)(a) A person shall not commit a fraudulent 
viatical settlement act.(b) A person shall not knowingly or intentionally interfere with the 
enforcement of the provisions of the Viatical Settlements Act or investigations of suspected or 
actual violations of the act.(c) A person in the business of viatical settlements shall not 
knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or 
breach of trust to participate in the business of viatical settlements.(2)(a) Viatical settlement 
contracts and applications for viatical settlements, regardless of the form of transmission, shall 
contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement: Any person who knowingly 
presents false information in an application for insurance or viatical settlement contract is guilty 
of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison.(b) The lack of a statement as 
required in this subsection does not constitute a defense in any prosecution for a fraudulent 

viatical settlement act.(3)(a) Any person engaged in the business of viatical settlements having 
knowledge or a reasonable suspicion that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or 
has been committed shall provide to the director the information required by, and in a manner 
prescribed by, the director.(b) Any other person having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a 
fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has been committed may provide to the 
director the information required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the director.(4)(a) No civil 
liability shall be imposed on and no cause of action shall arise from a person's furnishing 
information concerning suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent viatical settlement acts, 
if the information is provided to or received from:(i) The director or the director's employees, 
agents, or representatives;(ii) The Director of Banking and Finance or his or her employees, 
agents, or representatives;(iii) Federal, state, or local law enforcement officials or their

fraud; or(v) The life insurer that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the 
insured.(b) This subsection does not apply to statements made with actual malice, fraudulent 
intent, or bad faith. In an action brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other 
information concerning a fraudulent viatical settlement act, the party bringing the action shall 
plead specifically any allegation that this subsection does not apply because the person filing the 
report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice, fraudulent intent, or bad 
faith.(c) A person furnishing information as identified in this subsection shall be entitled to an 
award of attorney's fees and costs if he or she is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for 
libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of 
the Viatical Settlements Act and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in 
doing so. For purposes of this section, a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a reasonable 
basis in law or fact at the time it was initiated. An award granted under this subdivision shall not 
apply to any person furnishing information concerning his or her own fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts.(d) This section does not abrogate or modify common-law or statutory privileges 
or immunities enjoyed by a person described in this subsection.(5)(a) The documents and 
evidence provided pursuant to subsection (4) of this section or obtained by the director in an 
investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical settlement acts shall be privileged and 
confidential and shall not be a public record and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in 
a civil or criminal action.(b) This subsection does not prohibit release by the director of 
documents and evidence obtained in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts:(i) In administrative or judicial proceedings to enforce laws administered by the 
director;(ii) To federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory agencies, to an organization 
established for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraudulent viatical settlement acts, or to 
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; or(iii) At the discretion of the director, to 
a person in the business of viatical settlements that is aggrieved by a fraudulent viatical 
settlement act.(c) Release of documents and evidence under this subsection does not abrogate or 
modify the privilege granted in this subsection.(6) The Viatical Settlements Act shall 
not:(a) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law enforcement or regulatory agencies 
to investigate, examine, and prosecute suspected violations of law;(b) Prevent or prohibit a 
person from disclosing voluntarily information concerning viatical settlement fraud to a law 
enforcement or regulatory agency other than the department; or(c) Limit the powers granted 

elsewhere by the laws of this state to the director or an insurance fraud unit to investigate and 
examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action against 
wrongdoers.(7)(a) Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall have in 
place antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute, and prevent fraudulent 
viatical settlement acts. At the discretion of the director, the director may order, or a licensee 
may request and the director may grant, such modifications of the following required initiatives 
as necessary to ensure an effective antifraud program. The modifications may be more or less 
restrictive than the required initiatives so long as the modifications may reasonably be expected 
to accomplish the purpose of this section.(b) Antifraud initiatives shall include:(i) Fraud 
investigators, who may be viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker employees or 
independent contractors; and(ii) An antifraud plan submitted to the director. The antifraud plan

procedures for reporting possible fraudulent viatical settlement acts to the director;(C) A 
description of the plan for antifraud education and training of underwriters and other personnel; 
and(D) A description or chart outlining the organizational arrangement of the antifraud personnel 
who are responsible for the investigation and reporting of possible fraudulent viatical settlement 
acts and investigating unresolved material inconsistencies between medical records and

director.(4) When the director finds that an activity in violation of the act presents an immediate 
danger to the public that requires an immediate final order, the director may issue an emergency 
cease and desist order reciting with particularity the facts underlying the findings. The 
emergency cease and desist order is effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order on

of the Viatical Settlements Act to make restitution to persons aggrieved by violations of the 

act.(6) A person who is found by a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to an action initiated 
by the director, to have committed a fraudulent viatical settlement act, is subject to a civil penalty

violation, and fifteen thousand dollars for each subsequent violation.(7) A person convicted of a 
violation of the act by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be guilty of a Class III 
misdemeanor. A person convicted of a violation of the act shall be ordered to pay restitution to 
persons aggrieved by the violation. Restitution shall be ordered in addition to a fine or 
imprisonment, but not in lieu of a fine or imprisonment. A prosecution under this subsection 
shall be in lieu of an action under subsection (6) of this section.(8) Except for a fraudulent 
viatical settlement act committed by a viator, the enforcement provisions and penalties of this 
section shall not apply to a viator.

broker.(2) With respect to any viatical settlement contract or insurance policy, no viatical 
settlement provider shall knowingly enter into a viatical settlement contract with a viator if, in

section shall be a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(4) No viatical settlement provider shall enter 
into a viatical settlement contract unless the viatical settlement promotional, advertising, and 
marketing materials as may be prescribed by rule and regulation have been filed with the 
director. In no event shall any marketing materials expressly reference that the insurance is free 
for any period of time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would 
cause a viator to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be 
considered a violation of the Viatical Settlements Act.(5) No life insurance producer, insurance 
company, viatical settlement broker, or viatical settlement provider shall make any statement or 
representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life 
insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any 
period of time unless provided in the policy.
