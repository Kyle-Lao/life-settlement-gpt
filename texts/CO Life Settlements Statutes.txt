to the payment, transfer, deposit, or release of moneys from the date of the transaction; 
and(III) Other records and documents related to the requirements of this part 6.(b) This section

this subsection (2) to the commissioner after the retention period has expired if the person has 
retained the documents.(c) Records required to be retained by this subsection (2) shall be legible 
and complete and may be retained in paper, photograph, microprocess, magnetic, mechanical, or 
electronic media, or by any process that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for the

should be conducted, the commissioner shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or 
more examiners to perform the examination and instructing the examiner as to the scope of the 
examination. In conducting the examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and 
procedures set forth in the examiner's handbook adopted by the NAIC. The commissioner may 
also employ such other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem 
appropriate.(b) Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, and its officers, 
directors, and agents, shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and free access at all 
reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, assets, and 
computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the licensee 

being examined. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or person shall 
facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The 
refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to examination or 
to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for 
suspension, refusal, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in

testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as 
contempt of court.(d) When making an examination under this part 6, the commissioner may 
retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or 
other professionals and specialists as examiners. The reasonable cost of such examiners' services 
shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the examination.(e) Nothing contained in this 
part 6 shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an 
examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of 
this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima 
facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(f) Nothing contained in this part 6 shall be 
construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any 
final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee workpapers or other

examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in 
his or her sole discretion, deem appropriate.(g) The licensee shall pay the charges incurred in the 
examination, including the expenses of the commissioner or the commissioner's designee and the 
expenses and compensation of the commissioner's examiners and assistants. If a licensee 
believes that the fees assessed are unreasonable in relation to the examination performed, the 
licensee may appeal the assessments to and seek judicial review by the district court in and for 
the city and county of Denver pursuant to the "State Administrative Procedure Act", article 4 of 
title 24, C.R.S. If no hearing is requested or, if after a hearing and appeal process, the licensee

against the licensee to recover the expenses of examination.(4)Examination 
reports.(a) Examination reports shall consist only of facts appearing upon the books, records, or

testimony of its officers or agents or other persons examined concerning its affairs, and such 
conclusions and recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the 
facts.(b) No later than sixty days following completion of the examination, the examiner in 
charge shall file with the commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath. 
Upon receipt of the verified report, the commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee 
examined, together with a notice that shall afford the licensee examined a reasonable opportunity 
of not more than thirty days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters 
contained in the examination report.(c) Within thirty days after the end of the period allowed for 
the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and review 
the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the 

examiner's workpapers, and enter an order:(I) Adopting the examination report as filed or with 
modification or corrections. If the examination report reveals that the licensee is operating in 
violation of any law, rule, or prior order of the commissioner, the commissioner may order the 
licensee to take any action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure the 
violation.(II) Rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners to reopen the 
examination for purposes of obtaining additional data, documentation, or information and

testimony.(d) All orders entered pursuant to this subsection (4) shall be accompanied by findings 
and conclusions resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the examination 
report, the relevant examiner workpapers, and any written submissions or rebuttals. Any 
examination warrant issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section shall be 
considered a final administrative decision, review of which may be sought in the district court in 
and for the city and county of Denver pursuant to the "State Administrative Procedure Act", 
article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., and shall be served upon the licensee by certified mail together with a 
copy of the adopted examination report. Within thirty days after the issuance of the adopted 
report, the licensee shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors stating under oath that 
they have received a copy of the adopted report and related orders.(e) Hearings conducted 
pursuant to this section shall be subject to the following requirements:(I) Any hearing conducted 
pursuant to this section by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative 
shall be conducted as a nonadversarial, confidential investigatory proceeding as necessary for the 
resolution of any inconsistencies, discrepancies, or disputed issues apparent upon the face of the

workpapers or by the written submission or rebuttal of the licensee. Within twenty days after the 
conclusion of any hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order pursuant to subparagraph (I) of 
paragraph (c) of this subsection (4).(II) The commissioner shall not appoint an examiner as an 
authorized representative to conduct the hearing. The hearing shall proceed expeditiously, with 
discovery by the licensee limited to the examiner's workpapers that tend to substantiate any 
assertions set forth in any written submission or rebuttal. The commissioner or the 
commissioner's representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance of any witnesses or the 
production of any documents considered relevant to the investigation, whether under the control 
of the commissioner, the company, or other persons. The documents produced shall be included 
in the record, and testimony taken by the commissioner or the commissioner's representative 
shall be under oath and preserved for the record. Nothing contained in this section shall require 
the commissioner to disclose any information or records that would indicate or show the

materials, or information subject to paragraph (a) of this subsection (5), with other state, federal, 
and international regulatory agencies, with the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and with 
state, federal, and international law enforcement authorities if the recipient agrees to maintain the 
confidentiality and privileged status of the document, material, communication, or other 
information;(II) May receive documents, materials, communications, or information, including 
otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, from the NAIC and 
its affiliates and subsidiaries, and from regulatory and law enforcement officials of other foreign 
or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, 
material, or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or 
privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or 
information; and(III) May enter into agreements governing the sharing and use of information 
consistent with this subsection (5).(f) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of 
confidentiality in the documents, materials, or information shall occur as a result of disclosure to 
the commissioner under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in paragraph (e) of this 
subsection (5).(g) A privilege established under the law of any state or jurisdiction that is 
substantially similar to the privilege established under this subsection (5) shall be available and 

enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this state.(h) Nothing contained in this part 6 
shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an 
examination report, a preliminary examination report or its results, or any related matter to the 
commissioner of any other state or country, to law enforcement officials of this or any other state 
or agency of the federal government at any time, or to the NAIC, if the person receiving the 
report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner 
consistent with this part 6.(i) Nothing in this part 6 shall immunize a party who discloses 
information to the commissioner from disclosing that information pursuant to an independent 
inquiry or restrict the admissibility of such independently obtained information.(6)Conflict of 
interest.(a) An examiner may not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either 
directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of, or owns a 
pecuniary interest in, any person subject to examination under this part 6. This section shall not 
be construed to automatically preclude an examiner from being:(I) A viator;(II) An insured in a 
viaticated policy; or(III) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed to be the subject 
of a viatical settlement contract.(b) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a) of this 
subsection (6) to the contrary, the commissioner may retain from time to time, on an individual 
basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants, or other similar individuals who are 
independently practicing their professions, even though these persons may from time to time be 
similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination under provisions of this part 
6.(7)Cost of examinations. The expenses incurred in conducting any examination shall be paid 
by the licensee or applicant.(8)Immunity from liability.(a) No cause of action shall arise nor 
shall any liability be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized 
representatives, or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for any statements made or 
conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this part 6.(b) No cause of 
action shall arise from, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for, the act of 
communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner, the commissioner's 
authorized representative, or an examiner pursuant to an examination made under this part 6, if 
the act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent 
or the intent to deceive. This paragraph (b) does not abrogate or modify in any way any common 
law or statutory privilege or immunity enjoyed by any person identified in paragraph (a) of this 
subsection (8).(c) A person identified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection (8) shall be 
entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs if he or she is the prevailing party in a civil cause 
of action for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the 
provisions of this part 6, and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing 
so. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a reasonable 
basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.(9)Investigative authority of the 
commissioner. The commissioner may investigate suspected fraudulent viatical settlement acts 
and persons engaged in the business of viatical settlements. 
C.R.S. § 10-7-607 
Section 10-7-608 - Disclosures(1) With each application for a viatical settlement contract, a 
viatical settlement provider or life insurance producer shall provide the viator with at least the 
following information, in a separate document signed by the viator and the viatical settlement 
provider or life insurance producer, no later than the time the application for the viatical 
settlement contract is signed by all parties:(a) That there exist possible alternatives to a viatical 
settlement contract, including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the 

viator's life insurance policy;(b) That some or all of the proceeds of the viatical settlement 
contract may be taxable under federal income tax and state franchise and income taxes, and 
assistance may be sought from a professional tax advisor;(c) That proceeds of the viatical 
settlement contract may be subject to the claims of creditors;(d) That receipt of the proceeds of a 
viatical settlement contract may adversely affect the viator's eligibility for medicaid or other 
government benefits or entitlements, and advice may be obtained from the appropriate 
government agencies;(e) That the viator has the right to rescind a viatical settlement contract 
before the earlier of thirty calendar days after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract 
is executed by all parties or fifteen calendar days after the receipt of the viatical settlement 
proceeds by the viator. Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is effective only if both notice of 
the rescission is given and repayment of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest 
to the viatical settlement provider is made within forty-five days after the end of the rescission 
period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract is deemed 
to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all viatical settlement proceeds and any 
premiums, loans, and loan interest being made to the viatical settlement provider within the 
rescission period.(f) That funds must be sent to the viator within three business days after the 
viatical settlement provider has received the insurer's or group administrator's acknowledgment 
that ownership of the viaticated policy has been transferred and the beneficiary has been 
designated;(g) That entering into a viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, 
including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy, to 
be forfeited by the viator, and that the viator may seek assistance from an independent financial 
adviser;(h) The following statement: "All medical, financial, or personal information solicited or 
obtained by a viatical settlement provider or a life insurance producer about an insured, including 
the insured's identity or the identity of family members, a spouse, or a significant other, may be 
disclosed as necessary to effect the viatical settlement contract between the viator and the viatical 
settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to 
the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides 
funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every 
two years."(i) That the insured may be contacted by either the viatical settlement provider or its 
authorized representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status. This contact 
is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, 
and no more than once each month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less.(2) In 
addition to the information described in subsection (1) of this section, the disclosure to a viator 
shall include distribution of a brochure, approved by the commissioner, describing the process of 
viatical settlements.(3) No later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all 
parties, the viatical settlement provider shall provide the viator with at least the following 
information, displayed conspicuously in the viatical settlement contract or in a separate 
document signed by the viator and the viatical settlement provider:(a) The affiliation, if any, 
between the viatical settlement provider and the issuer of the insurance policy to be acquired 
pursuant to the viatical settlement contract;(b) The name, address, and telephone number of the 
viatical settlement provider;(c) If a policy to be acquired pursuant to a viatical settlement 
contract has been issued as a joint policy or involves family riders or any coverage of a life other 
than the insured under the policy to be acquired pursuant to a viatical settlement contract, the 
viator shall be informed of the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and 
advised to consult with his or her insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice 
on the proposed viatical settlement contract;(d) The dollar amount of the current death benefit 

payable to the viatical settlement provider under the policy. If known, the viatical settlement 
provider shall also disclose the availability of additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar 
amount of accidental death and dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate, and the 
viatical settlement provider's interest in those benefits.(e) The name, business address, and 
telephone number of the independent third-party escrow agent, and the fact that the viator may 
inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents.(4) If the 
viatical settlement provider transfers ownership or changes the beneficiary of the policy, the 
viatical settlement provider shall communicate the change in ownership or beneficiary to the 
insured within twenty days after the change. 
C.R.S. § 10-7-608 
Section 10-7-609 - General requirements(1)(a) A viatical settlement provider entering into a 
viatical settlement contract shall first obtain:(I) If the viator is the insured, a written statement 
from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or 
undue influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract; and(II) A document in which the 
insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a viatical settlement provider or 
insurance producer and, if the policy was issued less than two years after the date of application 
for a viatical settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy.(b) The insurer 
shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a viatical settlement provider 
or life insurance producer not later than thirty calendar days after the date the request is 
postmarked. The request for verification of coverage shall be made on a form approved by the 
commissioner. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in 
which respects it is unable to respond.(c) Before or at the time of execution of the viatical 
settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which 
the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and 
complete understanding of the viatical settlement contract, acknowledges that the viator has a 
full and complete understanding of the benefits of the policy, acknowledges that the viator is 
entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a 
terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic 
illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was 
issued.(d) If a life insurance producer performs any of the activities required of the viatical 
settlement provider by this subsection (1), the viatical settlement provider is deemed to have 
fulfilled the requirements of this section.(2) Medical information solicited or obtained by a 
licensee is subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to confidentiality of medical 
or protected health information.(3) A viatical settlement contract entered into in this state shall 
provide the viator with an unconditional right to rescind the contract before the earlier of thirty 
calendar days after the date when the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or 
fifteen calendar days after the receipt of the viatical settlement proceeds by the viator. 
Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given 
and repayment of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the viatical 
settlement provider is made within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission 
period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded if repayment of 
all viatical settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the viatical 
settlement provider is made within forty-five days after the end of the rescission period.(4) The 
viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to 
effect the change in ownership, assignment, or beneficiary directly to an independent escrow 

agent. If the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the viatical settlement 
provider, the viatical settlement provider shall immediately notify the escrow agent and shall pay 
or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement contract into an escrow or trust account 
maintained in a state or federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the 
federal deposit insurance corporation within three business days after the date the escrow agent 
receives the documents, or after the date the viatical settlement provider receives the documents. 
Upon payment of the viatical settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall 
deliver the original change in ownership, assignment, or beneficiary forms to the viatical 
settlement provider or related provider trust. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the 
acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment, or designation of 
beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the viatical settlement 
proceeds to the viator.(5) Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement 
contract within the time required renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator 
for lack of consideration until consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator.(6) A 
contact with the insured, for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the 
viatical settlement provider after the viatical settlement contract has been executed, may be made 
only by the licensed viatical settlement provider or its authorized representatives and is limited to 
once every three months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year, and not more 
than once each month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less. The viatical 
settlement provider shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time of entry into the 
viatical settlement contract. The limitations provided for in this subsection (6) do not apply to a 
contact with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. A viatical 
settlement provider is responsible for the actions of his or her authorized representatives. 
C.R.S. § 10-7-609 
Section 10-7-610 - Limited purchase in incontestability period(1) It is a violation of this part 6 
for a person to enter into a viatical settlement contract within a two-year period commencing 
with the date of issuance of the policy unless the viator certifies to the viatical settlement 
provider that one or more of the following conditions has been met within the two-year 
period:(a) The policy was issued upon the viator's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a 
group or individual policy, if the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the 
time covered under the prior policy is at least twenty-four months. The time covered under a 
group policy shall be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers if the coverage 
has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship.(b) The viator submits independent 
evidence to the viatical settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions has been 
met within the two-year period:(I) The viator or insured is terminally or chronically ill; 
or(II) The viator or insured disposes of his or her ownership interests in a closely held 
corporation pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the 
insurance policy was initially issued.(2) Copies of the independent evidence described in 
paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section and documents required must be submitted to the 
insurer when the viatical settlement provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of 
coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement 
provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical 
settlement provider.(3) If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of 
independent evidence provided for in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section when the 
viatical settlement provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to 

the viatical settlement provider, the copy is deemed to conclusively establish that the viatical 
settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section and the insurer shall respond timely 
to the request. 
C.R.S. § 10-7-610 
Section 10-7-611 - Advertising - legislative intent(1) It is the intent of the general assembly that 
the purpose of this section is to provide a prospective viator with clear and unambiguous 
statements in the advertisement of a viatical settlement contract and to assure the clear, truthful, 
and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of a viatical settlement 
contract. This purpose is to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of 
permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of a viatical settlement contract to 
assure that a product description is presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or 
misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of a viatical 
settlement contract through the advertising media and material used by a licensee.(2) This 
section applies to an advertising of a viatical settlement contract or a related product or service 
intended for dissemination in this state, including internet advertising viewed by a person located 
in this state. Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this 
section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation 
wherever possible.(3) Each viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a 
system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of an advertisement of its 
contracts, products, and services. An advertisement, regardless of by whom written, created, 
designed, or presented, is the responsibility of the licensee, as well as of the individual who 
created or presented the advertisement. A system of control by the licensee shall include regular 
notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized to disseminate advertisements, 
of the requirements and procedures for approval before the use of an advertisement not furnished 
by the licensee.(4) An advertisement shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by 
implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract shall be 
sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It may not have the capacity or tendency 
to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or 
deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the 
advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or 
intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(5)(a) The information 
required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of this section may not be minimized, 
rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the 
advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.(b) An advertisement may not omit material 
information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use 
has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving the public as to the nature or 
extent of any benefit, loss covered, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical 
settlement contract offered is made available for inspection before consummation of the sale, or 
that an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied, or that the viatical 
settlement contract includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, 
does not remedy misleading statements.(c) An advertisement may not use the name or title of a 
life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved in 
writing by the insurer.(d) An advertisement may not state or imply that interest charged on an 
accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or 
improper practice.(e) The words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional cost", or "at no 

extra cost", or words of similar import may not be used with respect to a benefit or service unless 
true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or service or may state that a charge 
is included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(f)(I) Any testimonial, appraisal, or 
analysis used in an advertisement shall:(A) Be genuine;(B) Represent the current opinion of the 
author;(C) Be applicable to the viatical settlement contract, product, or service advertised, if any; 
and(D) Be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving 
prospective viators as to the nature or scope of any testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement.(II) In using any testimonial, appraisal, or analysis, the viatical settlement licensee 
makes as its own all the statements contained in them, and the statements are subject to all the 
provisions of this section.(III) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement has a financial interest in the viatical settlement provider or related entity as a 
stockholder, director, officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives a benefit, directly or indirectly, 
other than required union scale wages, that fact must be disclosed prominently in the 
advertisement.(IV) An advertisement may not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract, 
benefit, or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association, 
or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization 
and the licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, 
controlled, or managed by the licensee or receives payment or other consideration from the 
licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact must be disclosed in the 
advertisement.(V) If an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement 
contract, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its use.(VI) An 
advertisement may not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and 
relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified.(VII) An 
advertisement may not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, insurance producers, 
policies, services, or methods of marketing.(VIII) The name of the viatical settlement licensee 
shall be identified clearly in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement 
contract, products, or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the 
viatical settlement contract must be identified either by form number or some other appropriate 
description. If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement 
provider shall be shown on the application.(IX) An advertisement may not use a trade name, 
group designation, name of the parent company of a licensee, name of a particular division of the 
licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name 
of the licensee if the advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the 
true identity of the licensee or to create the impression that a company other than the licensee has 
any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract.(X) An 
advertisement may not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by 
their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination 
of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise 
appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the 
solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.(XI) An 
advertisement may state that a licensee is licensed in the state where the advertisement appears if 
it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that a competing licensee may not be so 
licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the licensee's website or contact that 
state's division of insurance to find out if that state requires licensing and, if so, whether the 
licensee or any other company is licensed.(XII) An advertisement may not create the impression 
that the viatical settlement provider or its financial condition or status; the payment of its claims; 

or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts are recommended or 
endorsed by any government entity.(XIII) The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all 
of its advertisements. An advertisement may not use a trade name, group designation, name of 
any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in 
a manner that has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the 
actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity has any 
responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(XIV) An advertisement may not, 
directly or indirectly, create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the 
United States government endorses, approves, or favors:(A) A licensee or its business practices 
or methods of operation;(B) The merits, desirability, or advisability of a viatical settlement 
contract;(C) Any viatical settlement contract; or(D) Any policy or life insurance 
company.(XV) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatical settlement contract 
occurs, the advertising must disclose the average time frame, from completed application to the 
date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(XVI) If the 
advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the 
average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the 
licensee during the past six months. 
C.R.S. § 10-7-611 
Section 10-7-612 - Fraudulent acts(1)(a) A person shall not commit a fraudulent viatical 
settlement act.(b) A person shall not knowingly or intentionally interfere with the enforcement of 
the provisions of this part 6 or investigations of suspected or actual violations of this part 6.(c) A 
person in the business of viatical settlements shall not knowingly or intentionally permit a person 
convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust to participate in the business of 
viatical settlements.(2)(a) A viatical settlement contract and an application for a viatical 
settlement contract, regardless of the form of transmission, shall contain the following statement 
or a substantially similar statement: "Any person who knowingly presents false information in an 
application for insurance or viatical settlement contract is guilty of a crime and, upon conviction, 
may be subject to fines or confinement in prison, or both."(b) The lack of a statement as 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this subsection (2) does not constitute a defense in any 
prosecution for a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(3)(a) A person engaged in the business of 
viatical settlements having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement 
act is being, will be, or has been committed shall provide to the commissioner the information 
required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the commissioner.(b) Another person having 
knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has 
been committed may provide to the commissioner the information required by, and in a manner 
prescribed by, the commissioner.(4)(a) No civil liability shall be imposed upon, and no cause of 
action shall arise from the otherwise lawful conduct of, a person who furnishes information 
concerning suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent viatical settlement acts, or suspected 
or completed fraudulent insurance acts, if the information is provided to or received from:(I) The 
commissioner or the commissioner's employees, agents, or representatives;(II) Federal, state, or 
local law enforcement or regulatory officials or their employees, agents, or 
representatives;(III) A person involved in the prevention and detection of fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts or that person's agents, employees, or representatives;(IV) The NAIC, the 
national association of securities dealers, or the North American securities administrators 
association, or their employees, agents, or representatives, or another regulatory body overseeing 

life insurance or viatical settlement contracts; or(V) The insurer that issued the policy covering 
the life of the insured.(b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection (4) does not apply to a statement made 
with actual malice. In an action brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other 
information concerning a fraudulent viatical settlement act or a fraudulent insurance act, the 
party bringing the action shall plead specifically any allegation that paragraph (a) of this 
subsection (4) does not apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information 
did so with actual malice.(c) A person identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection (4) is entitled 
to an award of attorney fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of 
action for libel, slander, or another relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the 
provisions of this part 6 and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing 
so. For purposes of this section, a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a reasonable basis 
in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.(d) This section does not abrogate or modify 
common law or statutory privileges or immunities enjoyed by a person described in paragraph 
(a) of this subsection (4).(e) Paragraph (a) of this subsection (4) does not apply to a person's 
furnishing information concerning the person's own suspected, anticipated, or completed 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts or suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent insurance 
acts.(5)(a) The documents and evidence provided pursuant to subsection (4) of this section or 
obtained by the commissioner in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts are privileged and confidential, are not a public record, and are not subject to 
discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal action.(b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection (5) does 
not prohibit release by the commissioner of documents and evidence obtained in an investigation 
of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical settlement acts:(I) In administrative or judicial 
proceedings to enforce laws administered by the commissioner;(II) To federal, state, or local law 
enforcement or regulatory agencies, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting 
and preventing fraudulent viatical settlement acts, or to the NAIC; or(III) At the discretion of the 
commissioner, to a person in the business of viatical settlements that is aggrieved by a fraudulent 
viatical settlement act.(c) Release of documents and evidence pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
subsection (5) does not abrogate or modify the privilege granted in paragraph (a) of this 
subsection (5).(6) This part 6 does not:(a) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law 
enforcement or regulatory agencies to investigate, examine, and prosecute suspected violations 
of law;(b) Prevent or prohibit a person from voluntarily disclosing information concerning 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts to a law enforcement or regulatory agency other than the 
division; or(c) Limit the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to the commissioner 
or to an insurance fraud unit to investigate and examine possible violations of law and to take 
appropriate action against wrongdoers.(7)(a) A viatical settlement provider shall adopt anti-fraud 
initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, assist in the prosecution of, and prevent fraudulent 
viatical settlement acts. The commissioner may order or, if a licensee requests, may grant 
modifications of the following initiatives as necessary to ensure an effective anti-fraud program. 
The modifications may be more or less restrictive than the initiatives if the modifications may 
reasonably be expected to accomplish the purpose of this section. Anti-fraud initiatives 
include:(I) Fraud investigators, who may be viatical settlement providers or employees or 
independent contractors of those viatical settlement providers; and(II) An anti-fraud plan that is 
submitted to the commissioner. The anti-fraud plan shall include, but not be limited to:(A) A 
chart outlining the organizational arrangement of the anti-fraud personnel who are responsible 
for the investigation and reporting of possible fraudulent viatical settlement acts and 
investigating unresolved material inconsistencies between medical records and insurance 

applications; and(B) A description of the procedures for detecting and investigating possible 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts and procedures for resolving material inconsistencies between

to the commissioner are privileged and confidential, are not public records pursuant to article 72 
of title 24, C.R.S., and are not subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal action. 
C.R.S. § 10-7-612 
Section 10-7-613 - Penalties(1) In addition to the penalties and other enforcement provisions of 
this part 6, if a person violates the provisions of this part 6 or any rule implementing this part 6, 
the commissioner may seek an injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction and may apply for 
temporary and permanent orders as the commissioner determines are necessary to restrain the 
person from committing the violation.(2) A person damaged by the acts of a person in violation 
of this part 6 may bring a civil action against the person committing the violation in a court of 
competent jurisdiction.(3) The commissioner may issue a cease-and-desist order to a person who 
violates any provision of this part 6 or of any rule or order promulgated by, or written agreement 
entered into with, the commissioner pursuant to this part 6.(4) When the commissioner finds that 
an activity in violation of this part 6 presents an immediate danger to the public that requires an 
immediate final order, the commissioner may issue an emergency cease-and-desist order reciting 
with particularity the facts underlying the findings. The emergency cease-and-desist order is 
effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order on the respondent and remains 
effective for ninety days. If the commissioner begins nonemergency cease-and-desist 
proceedings, the emergency cease-and-desist order remains effective absent an order by a court 
of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the "State Administrative Procedure Act", article 4 of title 
24, C.R.S.(5) In addition to the penalties and other enforcement provisions of this part 6, a 
person who violates this part 6 is subject to civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars for each 
violation pursuant to an order of the commissioner. The commissioner's order may require a 
person found to be in violation of this part 6 to make restitution to a person aggrieved by 
violations of this part 6.(6)(a) A person who violates a provision of this part 6 after the 
commissioner has issued a cease-and-desist order to the person commits a class 2 misdemeanor 
and, upon conviction, shall pay restitution to a person aggrieved by the violation. Restitution 
shall be ordered in addition to a fine or imprisonment, but not instead of a fine or 
imprisonment.(b) A person who violates paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), upon conviction, 
shall be sentenced based on the greater of the value of property, services, or other benefits 
wrongfully obtained or attempted to be obtained, or the aggregate economic loss suffered by any 
person as a result of the violation. A person shall be fined not more than:(I) One hundred 
thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than twelve months, or both, if the value of the 
viatical settlement contract is more than thirty-five thousand dollars;(II) Twenty thousand dollars 
or imprisoned for not more than nine months, or both, if the value of the viatical settlement 
contract is more than two thousand five hundred dollars but not more than thirty-five thousand 
dollars;(III) Ten thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, if the 
value of the viatical settlement contract is more than five hundred dollars but not more than two 
thousand five hundred dollars; or(IV) Three thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than 
three months, or both, if the value of the viatical settlement contract is five hundred dollars or 
less.(c) In a prosecution under paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), the value of a viatical 

settlement contract within a six-month period may be aggregated and the defendant charged 
accordingly in applying the provisions of this section. If two or more offenses are committed by 
the same person in two or more counties, the accused may be prosecuted in a county in which 
one of the offenses was committed for all of the offenses aggregated as provided by this section. 
The statutory limitation period does not begin to run until the insurance company or law 
enforcement agency is aware of the fraud, but the prosecution may not be commenced later than 
seven years after the act has occurred.
