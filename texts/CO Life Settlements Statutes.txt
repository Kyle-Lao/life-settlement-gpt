facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The 
refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to examination or

part 6 shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an 
examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of 
this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima 
facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(f) Nothing contained in this part 6 shall be 
construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any

facts.(b) No later than sixty days following completion of the examination, the examiner in 
charge shall file with the commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath.

contained in the examination report.(c) Within thirty days after the end of the period allowed for 
the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and review 
the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the 

examiner's workpapers, and enter an order:(I) Adopting the examination report as filed or with

and conclusions resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the examination 
report, the relevant examiner workpapers, and any written submissions or rebuttals. Any 
examination warrant issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section shall be 
considered a final administrative decision, review of which may be sought in the district court in

conclusion of any hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order pursuant to subparagraph (I) of 
paragraph (c) of this subsection (4).(II) The commissioner shall not appoint an examiner as an 
authorized representative to conduct the hearing. The hearing shall proceed expeditiously, with

consistent with this subsection (5).(f) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of 
confidentiality in the documents, materials, or information shall occur as a result of disclosure to 
the commissioner under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in paragraph (e) of this 
subsection (5).(g) A privilege established under the law of any state or jurisdiction that is 
substantially similar to the privilege established under this subsection (5) shall be available and 

enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this state.(h) Nothing contained in this part 6 
shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an 
examination report, a preliminary examination report or its results, or any related matter to the 
commissioner of any other state or country, to law enforcement officials of this or any other state 
or agency of the federal government at any time, or to the NAIC, if the person receiving the 
report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner 
consistent with this part 6.(i) Nothing in this part 6 shall immunize a party who discloses 
information to the commissioner from disclosing that information pursuant to an independent 
inquiry or restrict the admissibility of such independently obtained information.(6)Conflict of 
interest.(a) An examiner may not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either 
directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of, or owns a 
pecuniary interest in, any person subject to examination under this part 6. This section shall not 
be construed to automatically preclude an examiner from being:(I) A viator;(II) An insured in a 
viaticated policy; or(III) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed to be the subject 
of a viatical settlement contract.(b) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a) of this 
subsection (6) to the contrary, the commissioner may retain from time to time, on an individual

provider or life insurance producer, no later than the time the application for the viatical 
settlement contract is signed by all parties:(a) That there exist possible alternatives to a viatical 
settlement contract, including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the 

viator's life insurance policy;(b) That some or all of the proceeds of the viatical settlement 
contract may be taxable under federal income tax and state franchise and income taxes, and 
assistance may be sought from a professional tax advisor;(c) That proceeds of the viatical 
settlement contract may be subject to the claims of creditors;(d) That receipt of the proceeds of a 
viatical settlement contract may adversely affect the viator's eligibility for medicaid or other

before the earlier of thirty calendar days after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract 
is executed by all parties or fifteen calendar days after the receipt of the viatical settlement

the rescission is given and repayment of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest 
to the viatical settlement provider is made within forty-five days after the end of the rescission 
period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract is deemed 
to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all viatical settlement proceeds and any 
premiums, loans, and loan interest being made to the viatical settlement provider within the 
rescission period.(f) That funds must be sent to the viator within three business days after the 
viatical settlement provider has received the insurer's or group administrator's acknowledgment 
that ownership of the viaticated policy has been transferred and the beneficiary has been 
designated;(g) That entering into a viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, 
including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy, to 
be forfeited by the viator, and that the viator may seek assistance from an independent financial 
adviser;(h) The following statement: "All medical, financial, or personal information solicited or 
obtained by a viatical settlement provider or a life insurance producer about an insured, including 
the insured's identity or the identity of family members, a spouse, or a significant other, may be 
disclosed as necessary to effect the viatical settlement contract between the viator and the viatical 
settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to 
the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides 
funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every 
two years."(i) That the insured may be contacted by either the viatical settlement provider or its 
authorized representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status. This contact 
is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, 
and no more than once each month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less.(2) In 
addition to the information described in subsection (1) of this section, the disclosure to a viator 
shall include distribution of a brochure, approved by the commissioner, describing the process of 
viatical settlements.(3) No later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all 
parties, the viatical settlement provider shall provide the viator with at least the following 
information, displayed conspicuously in the viatical settlement contract or in a separate

advised to consult with his or her insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice 
on the proposed viatical settlement contract;(d) The dollar amount of the current death benefit

viatical settlement provider's interest in those benefits.(e) The name, business address, and 
telephone number of the independent third-party escrow agent, and the fact that the viator may 
inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents.(4) If the

viatical settlement provider shall communicate the change in ownership or beneficiary to the 
insured within twenty days after the change.

Section 10-7-609 - General requirements(1)(a) A viatical settlement provider entering into a 
viatical settlement contract shall first obtain:(I) If the viator is the insured, a written statement 
from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or 
undue influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract; and(II) A document in which the 
insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a viatical settlement provider or 
insurance producer and, if the policy was issued less than two years after the date of application 
for a viatical settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy.(b) The insurer 
shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a viatical settlement provider 
or life insurance producer not later than thirty calendar days after the date the request is 
postmarked. The request for verification of coverage shall be made on a form approved by the 
commissioner. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in 
which respects it is unable to respond.(c) Before or at the time of execution of the viatical 
settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which 
the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and 
complete understanding of the viatical settlement contract, acknowledges that the viator has a 
full and complete understanding of the benefits of the policy, acknowledges that the viator is 
entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a 
terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic 
illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was 
issued.(d) If a life insurance producer performs any of the activities required of the viatical 
settlement provider by this subsection (1), the viatical settlement provider is deemed to have 
fulfilled the requirements of this section.(2) Medical information solicited or obtained by a 
licensee is subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to confidentiality of medical 
or protected health information.(3) A viatical settlement contract entered into in this state shall 
provide the viator with an unconditional right to rescind the contract before the earlier of thirty 
calendar days after the date when the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or 
fifteen calendar days after the receipt of the viatical settlement proceeds by the viator. 
Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given 
and repayment of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the viatical 
settlement provider is made within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission 
period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded if repayment of 
all viatical settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the viatical 
settlement provider is made within forty-five days after the end of the rescission period.(4) The 
viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to 
effect the change in ownership, assignment, or beneficiary directly to an independent escrow 

agent. If the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the viatical settlement 
provider, the viatical settlement provider shall immediately notify the escrow agent and shall pay 
or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement contract into an escrow or trust account 
maintained in a state or federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the 
federal deposit insurance corporation within three business days after the date the escrow agent 
receives the documents, or after the date the viatical settlement provider receives the documents. 
Upon payment of the viatical settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall 
deliver the original change in ownership, assignment, or beneficiary forms to the viatical 
settlement provider or related provider trust. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the 
acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment, or designation of 
beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the viatical settlement 
proceeds to the viator.(5) Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement 
contract within the time required renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator 
for lack of consideration until consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator.(6) A 
contact with the insured, for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the 
viatical settlement provider after the viatical settlement contract has been executed, may be made 
only by the licensed viatical settlement provider or its authorized representatives and is limited to 
once every three months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year, and not more 
than once each month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less. The viatical 
settlement provider shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time of entry into the 
viatical settlement contract. The limitations provided for in this subsection (6) do not apply to a 
contact with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. A viatical 
settlement provider is responsible for the actions of his or her authorized representatives.

Section 10-7-610 - Limited purchase in incontestability period(1) It is a violation of this part 6 
for a person to enter into a viatical settlement contract within a two-year period commencing 
with the date of issuance of the policy unless the viator certifies to the viatical settlement 
provider that one or more of the following conditions has been met within the two-year 
period:(a) The policy was issued upon the viator's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a 
group or individual policy, if the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the 
time covered under the prior policy is at least twenty-four months. The time covered under a 
group policy shall be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers if the coverage 
has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship.(b) The viator submits independent 
evidence to the viatical settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions has been 
met within the two-year period:(I) The viator or insured is terminally or chronically ill; 
or(II) The viator or insured disposes of his or her ownership interests in a closely held 
corporation pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the 
insurance policy was initially issued.(2) Copies of the independent evidence described in 
paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section and documents required must be submitted to the 
insurer when the viatical settlement provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of 
coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement 
provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical 
settlement provider.(3) If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of 
independent evidence provided for in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section when the 
viatical settlement provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to 

the viatical settlement provider, the copy is deemed to conclusively establish that the viatical 
settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section and the insurer shall respond timely 
to the request.

Section 10-7-611 - Advertising - legislative intent(1) It is the intent of the general assembly that 
the purpose of this section is to provide a prospective viator with clear and unambiguous 
statements in the advertisement of a viatical settlement contract and to assure the clear, truthful, 
and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of a viatical settlement 
contract. This purpose is to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of 
permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of a viatical settlement contract to 
assure that a product description is presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or 
misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of a viatical 
settlement contract through the advertising media and material used by a licensee.(2) This 
section applies to an advertising of a viatical settlement contract or a related product or service 
intended for dissemination in this state, including internet advertising viewed by a person located 
in this state. Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this 
section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation 
wherever possible.(3) Each viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a 
system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of an advertisement of its 
contracts, products, and services. An advertisement, regardless of by whom written, created, 
designed, or presented, is the responsibility of the licensee, as well as of the individual who 
created or presented the advertisement. A system of control by the licensee shall include regular 
notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized to disseminate advertisements, 
of the requirements and procedures for approval before the use of an advertisement not furnished 
by the licensee.(4) An advertisement shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by 
implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract shall be 
sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It may not have the capacity or tendency 
to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or 
deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the 
advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or 
intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(5)(a) The information 
required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of this section may not be minimized, 
rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the 
advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.(b) An advertisement may not omit material 
information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use 
has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving the public as to the nature or 
extent of any benefit, loss covered, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical 
settlement contract offered is made available for inspection before consummation of the sale, or 
that an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied, or that the viatical 
settlement contract includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, 
does not remedy misleading statements.(c) An advertisement may not use the name or title of a 
life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved in 
writing by the insurer.(d) An advertisement may not state or imply that interest charged on an 
accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or 
improper practice.(e) The words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional cost", or "at no 

extra cost", or words of similar import may not be used with respect to a benefit or service unless 
true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or service or may state that a charge 
is included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(f)(I) Any testimonial, appraisal, or 
analysis used in an advertisement shall:(A) Be genuine;(B) Represent the current opinion of the 
author;(C) Be applicable to the viatical settlement contract, product, or service advertised, if any; 
and(D) Be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving 
prospective viators as to the nature or scope of any testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement.(II) In using any testimonial, appraisal, or analysis, the viatical settlement licensee 
makes as its own all the statements contained in them, and the statements are subject to all the 
provisions of this section.(III) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement has a financial interest in the viatical settlement provider or related entity as a 
stockholder, director, officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives a benefit, directly or indirectly, 
other than required union scale wages, that fact must be disclosed prominently in the 
advertisement.(IV) An advertisement may not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract, 
benefit, or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association, 
or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization 
and the licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, 
controlled, or managed by the licensee or receives payment or other consideration from the 
licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact must be disclosed in the 
advertisement.(V) If an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement 
contract, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its use.(VI) An 
advertisement may not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and 
relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified.(VII) An 
advertisement may not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, insurance producers, 
policies, services, or methods of marketing.(VIII) The name of the viatical settlement licensee 
shall be identified clearly in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement 
contract, products, or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the 
viatical settlement contract must be identified either by form number or some other appropriate 
description. If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement 
provider shall be shown on the application.(IX) An advertisement may not use a trade name, 
group designation, name of the parent company of a licensee, name of a particular division of the 
licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name 
of the licensee if the advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the 
true identity of the licensee or to create the impression that a company other than the licensee has 
any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract.(X) An 
advertisement may not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by 
their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination 
of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise 
appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the 
solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.(XI) An 
advertisement may state that a licensee is licensed in the state where the advertisement appears if 
it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that a competing licensee may not be so 
licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the licensee's website or contact that 
state's division of insurance to find out if that state requires licensing and, if so, whether the 
licensee or any other company is licensed.(XII) An advertisement may not create the impression 
that the viatical settlement provider or its financial condition or status; the payment of its claims; 

or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts are recommended or 
endorsed by any government entity.(XIII) The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all 
of its advertisements. An advertisement may not use a trade name, group designation, name of 
any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in 
a manner that has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the 
actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity has any 
responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(XIV) An advertisement may not, 
directly or indirectly, create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the 
United States government endorses, approves, or favors:(A) A licensee or its business practices 
or methods of operation;(B) The merits, desirability, or advisability of a viatical settlement 
contract;(C) Any viatical settlement contract; or(D) Any policy or life insurance 
company.(XV) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatical settlement contract 
occurs, the advertising must disclose the average time frame, from completed application to the 
date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(XVI) If the 
advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the 
average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the 
licensee during the past six months.

subsection (4) does not apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information 
did so with actual malice.(c) A person identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection (4) is entitled 
to an award of attorney fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of 
action for libel, slander, or another relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the 
provisions of this part 6 and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing 
so. For purposes of this section, a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a reasonable basis 
in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.(d) This section does not abrogate or modify 
common law or statutory privileges or immunities enjoyed by a person described in paragraph 
(a) of this subsection (4).(e) Paragraph (a) of this subsection (4) does not apply to a person's 
furnishing information concerning the person's own suspected, anticipated, or completed

obtained by the commissioner in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts are privileged and confidential, are not a public record, and are not subject to 
discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal action.(b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection (5) does 
not prohibit release by the commissioner of documents and evidence obtained in an investigation 
of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical settlement acts:(I) In administrative or judicial 
proceedings to enforce laws administered by the commissioner;(II) To federal, state, or local law 
enforcement or regulatory agencies, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting

commissioner, to a person in the business of viatical settlements that is aggrieved by a fraudulent 
viatical settlement act.(c) Release of documents and evidence pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
subsection (5) does not abrogate or modify the privilege granted in paragraph (a) of this

modifications of the following initiatives as necessary to ensure an effective anti-fraud program. 
The modifications may be more or less restrictive than the initiatives if the modifications may

competent jurisdiction.(3) The commissioner may issue a cease-and-desist order to a person who 
violates any provision of this part 6 or of any rule or order promulgated by, or written agreement 
entered into with, the commissioner pursuant to this part 6.(4) When the commissioner finds that 
an activity in violation of this part 6 presents an immediate danger to the public that requires an 
immediate final order, the commissioner may issue an emergency cease-and-desist order reciting 
with particularity the facts underlying the findings. The emergency cease-and-desist order is 
effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order on the respondent and remains 
effective for ninety days. If the commissioner begins nonemergency cease-and-desist

violations of this part 6.(6)(a) A person who violates a provision of this part 6 after the 
commissioner has issued a cease-and-desist order to the person commits a class 2 misdemeanor

shall be ordered in addition to a fine or imprisonment, but not instead of a fine or 
imprisonment.(b) A person who violates paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), upon conviction, 
shall be sentenced based on the greater of the value of property, services, or other benefits 
wrongfully obtained or attempted to be obtained, or the aggregate economic loss suffered by any 
person as a result of the violation. A person shall be fined not more than:(I) One hundred 
thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than twelve months, or both, if the value of the 
viatical settlement contract is more than thirty-five thousand dollars;(II) Twenty thousand dollars 
or imprisoned for not more than nine months, or both, if the value of the viatical settlement 
contract is more than two thousand five hundred dollars but not more than thirty-five thousand 
dollars;(III) Ten thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, if the 
value of the viatical settlement contract is more than five hundred dollars but not more than two 
thousand five hundred dollars; or(IV) Three thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than 
three months, or both, if the value of the viatical settlement contract is five hundred dollars or 
less.(c) In a prosecution under paragraph (a) of this subsection (6), the value of a viatical 

settlement contract within a six-month period may be aggregated and the defendant charged 
accordingly in applying the provisions of this section. If two or more offenses are committed by 
the same person in two or more counties, the accused may be prosecuted in a county in which 
one of the offenses was committed for all of the offenses aggregated as provided by this section. 
The statutory limitation period does not begin to run until the insurance company or law 
enforcement agency is aware of the fraud, but the prosecution may not be commenced later than 
seven years after the act has occurred.
