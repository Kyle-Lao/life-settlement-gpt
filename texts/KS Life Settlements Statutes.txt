or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material 
or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged 
under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material or information; 
and(C) enter into agreements governing sharing and use of information consistent with this 
subsection.(6) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the 
documents, materials or information shall occur as a result of disclosure to the commissioner 
under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in subsection (e)(4).(7) A privilege 
established under the law of any state or jurisdiction that is substantially similar to the privilege 
established under this subsection shall be available and enforced in any proceeding in, and in any 
court of, this state.(8) Nothing contained in this act shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting 
the commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination 
report or results, or any matter relating thereto, to the commissioner of any other state or country, 

or to law enforcement officials of this or any other state or agency of the federal government at 
any time or to the NAIC, so long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating 
thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this act.(f)(1) An 
examiner may not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, 
has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary interest in 
any person subject to examination under this act. This section shall not be construed to 
automatically preclude an examiner from being:(A) A viator;(B) an insured in a viaticated 
insurance policy; or(C) a beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed to be 
viaticated.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this clause, the commissioner may retain from 
time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants or other 
similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions, even though these persons 
may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination 
under this act.(g) Unless provided otherwise, all fees and procedures for examinations under this 
act shall be in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223, and amendments thereto.(h)(1) No cause of 
action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner's 
authorized representatives or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for any statements 
made or conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this act.(2) No 
cause of action shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of 
communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner's 
authorized representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this act, if the act 
of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the 
intent to deceive. This paragraph does not abrogate or modify in any way any common law or 
statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in paragraph 
(1).(3) A person identified in paragraph (1) or (2) shall be entitled to an award of attorney fees 
and costs if such person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander or any 
other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of this act and the party 
bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this section a 
proceeding is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it 
was initiated.(i) The commissioner may investigate suspected fraudulent viatical settlement acts 
and persons engaged in the business of viatical settlements. 
K.S.A. 40-5007a 
Section 40-5008 - Same; required disclosures(a) With each application for a viatical settlement, a 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator with at least the 
following disclosures no later than the time the application for the viatical settlement contract is 
signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be provided in a separate document that is signed by 
the viator and the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, and shall provide the 
following information:(1) There are possible alternatives to viatical settlement contracts 
including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the viator's life insurance 
policy.(2) That a viatical settlement broker represents exclusively the viator and not the insurer 
or the viatical settlement provider. Furthermore the viatical settlement broker owes a fiduciary 
duty to the viator including the duty to act according to the viator's instructions and in the best 
interest of the viator.(3) Some or all of the proceeds of the viatical settlement may be taxable 
under federal income tax and state franchise and income taxes, and assistance should be sought 
from a professional tax advisor.(4) Proceeds of the viatical settlement could be subject to the 
claims of creditors.(5) Receipt of the proceeds of a viatical settlement may adversely affect the 

viator's eligibility for medicaid or other government benefits or entitlements, and advice should 
be obtained from the appropriate government agencies.(6) The viator has the right to rescind a 
viatical settlement contract for 15 calendar days after the receipt of the viatical settlement 
proceeds by the viator, as provided in subsection (c) of K.S.A. 40-5009a, and amendments 
thereto. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the settlement contract shall be deemed 
to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all viatical settlement proceeds and any 
premiums, loans and loan interest to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser.(7) Funds will 
be sent to the viator within three business days after the viatical settlement provider has received 
the insurer or group administrator's acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest in 
the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated.(8) Entering into a 
viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and 
waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate, to be forfeited by the 
viator. Assistance should be sought from a financial adviser.(9) Disclosure to a viator shall 
include distribution of a brochure describing the process of viatical settlements. The form for the 
brochure shall be developed by the commissioner.(10) The disclosure document shall contain the 
following language: "All medical, financial or personal information solicited or obtained by a 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker about an insured, including the insured's 
identity or the identity of family members, a spouse or a significant other may be disclosed as 
necessary to effect the viatical settlement between the viator and the viatical settlement provider. 
If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The 
information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the 
purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every two 
years."(11) The insured may be contacted by either the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker or such viatical settlement provider's or viatical settlement broker's authorized 
representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status. This contact is limited to 
once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and no more 
than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less.(b) A viatical 
settlement provider shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures no later than 
the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be 
conspicuously displayed in the viatical settlement contract or in a separate document signed by 
the viator and the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, and contain the 
following information:(1) The affiliation, if any, between the viatical settlement provider and the 
issuer of the insurance policy to be viaticated.(2) The name, address and telephone number of the 
viatical settlement provider.(3) A viatical settlement broker shall disclose to a prospective viator 
the amount and method of calculating the broker's compensation. The term "compensation" 
includes anything of value paid or given to a viatical settlement broker for the placement of a 
policy.(4) If an insurance policy to be viaticated has been issued as a joint policy or involves 
family riders or any coverage of a life other than the insured under the policy to be viaticated, the 
viator shall be informed of the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and 
shall be advised to consult with such viator's insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy 
for advice on the proposed viatical settlement.(5) State the dollar amount of the current death 
benefit payable to the viatical settlement provider under the policy or certificate. If known, the 
viatical settlement provider shall also disclose the availability of any additional guaranteed 
insurance benefits, the dollar amount of any accidental death and dismemberment benefits under 
the policy or certificate and the viatical settlement provider's interest in those benefits.(6) State 
the name, business address and telephone number of the independent third party escrow agent, 

and the fact that the viator or owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust 
agreements or documents.(c) Without limiting the ability of an insurer from assessing the 
insurability of a policy applicant and determining whether or not to issue the policy, and in 
addition to other questions an insurance carrier may lawfully pose to a life insurance applicant, 
insurance carriers may inquire in the application for insurance whether the proposed owner 
intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will use the policy as 
collateral to support the financing.(1) If, as described in paragraph (3) of subsection (o) of K.S.A. 
40-5002, and amendments thereto, the loan provides funds which can be used for a purpose other 
than paying for the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the 
life insurance policy and loan, the application shall be rejected as a violation of this act.(2) If the 
financing does not violate this section in this manner, the insurance carrier:(A) May make 
disclosures, including, but not limited to, such as the following, to the applicant and the insured, 
either on the application or an amendment to the application to be completed no later than the 
delivery of the policy: 
"If you have entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral, and the 
policy does change ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the 
following may be true: 
(i) A change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;(ii) a 
change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the 
insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one 
life;(iii) should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage 
on the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, or 
other factors, or both, may reduce the ability to obtain coverage or may result in significantly 
higher premiums or both;(iv) you should consult a professional advisor, since a change in 
ownership in satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on 
the structure of the loan;" and(B) may require certifications, such as the following, from the 
applicant or the insured or both:(i)" I have not entered into any agreement or arrangement 
providing for the future sale of this life insurance policy;(ii) my loan arrangement for this policy 
provides funds sufficient to pay for some or all of the premiums, costs, and expenses associated 
with obtaining and maintaining my life insurance policy, but I have not entered into any 
agreement by which I am to receive consideration in exchange for procuring this policy; 
and(iii) the borrower has an insurable interest in the insured." 
K.S.A. 40-5008 
Section 40-5009a - Same; viatical settlement contract; required documents; confidentiality of 
medical information; viator's rights; payment of proceeds; contacts with viator; 
limitations(a)(1) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical settlement contract shall 
first obtain:(A) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending 
physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter 
into a viatical settlement contract; and(B) a document in which the insured consents to the 
release of such insured's medical records to a viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement 
broker and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the 
insured.(2) Within 20 days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights 
under an insurance policy or within 20 days of entering any agreement, option, promise or any 
other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement 

provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy 
has or will become a viaticated policy. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents 
required by paragraph (3).(3) The viatical settlement provider shall deliver a copy of the medical 
release required under paragraph (1)(B), a copy of the viator's application for the viatical 
settlement contract, the notice required under paragraph (2) and a request for verification of 
coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. 
The form for verification shall be developed by the commissioner.(4) The insurer shall respond 
to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement 
provider within 30 calendar days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, 
based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an 
investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract.(5) Prior to or at the 
time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain 
a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents 
that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the viatical settlement contract, that such 
viator has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, 
acknowledges that such viator is entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and 
voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the 
insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was 
diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.(6) If a viatical settlement broker performs 
any of these activities required of the viatical settlement provider, the viatical settlement provider 
is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.(b) All medical information solicited 
or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to 
confidentiality of medical information.(c) All viatical settlement contracts entered into in this 
state shall provide the viator with an unconditional right to rescind the contract for at least 15 
calendar days from the receipt of the viatical settlement proceeds. If the insured dies during the 
rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject 
to repayment to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, 
and any premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider 
or purchaser.(d) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed 
documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary 
directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three business days after the date the escrow 
agent receives the document, or from the date the viatical settlement provider receives the 
documents, if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, the 
provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement into an escrow or trust 
account maintained in a state or federally-chartered financial institution whose deposits are 
insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation. Upon payment of the settlement proceeds 
into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, 
assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider 
trust. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer 
of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow 
agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.(e) Failure to tender consideration to the 
viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time disclosed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-
5008(a)(6), and amendments thereto, renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the 
viator for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the 
viator.(f) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured 
by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has 

occurred shall only be made by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker 
licensed in this state or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three 
months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per 
month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less. The viatical settlement provider or 
viatical settlement broker shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the viatical 
settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to 
any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. 
Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall be responsible for the actions 
of their authorized representatives. 
K.S.A. 40-5009a 
Section 40-5010 - Same; two year prohibition on entering into viatical settlement; exceptions 
No person at any time prior to, or at the time of, the application for or issuance of a policy, or 
during a two-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the policy, shall enter into a 
viatical settlement* regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of 
the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest or surrender of the policy is to occur. This 
prohibition shall not apply if the viator certifies to the viatical settlement provider that: 
(a) The policy was issued upon the viator's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or 
individual policy, provided the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the 
time covered under the prior policy is at least 24 months. The time covered under a group policy 
shall be calculated without regard to any change in insurance carriers, provided the coverage has 
been continuous and under the same group sponsorship;(b) The viator submits independent 
evidence to the viatical settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions have 
been met within the two-year period:(1) The viator or insured is terminally or chronically 
ill;(2) the viator's spouse dies;(3) the viator divorces such viator's spouse;(4) the viator retires 
from full-time employment;(5) the viator becomes physically or mentally disabled and a 
physician determines that the disability prevents the viator from maintaining full-time 
employment;(6) a final order, judgment or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, 
on the application of a creditor of the viator, adjudicating the viator bankrupt or insolvent, or 
approving a petition seeking reorganization of the viator or appointing a receiver, trustee or 
liquidator to all or a substantial part of the viator's assets; or(7) the beneficiary of the policy is a 
family member of the viator and the beneficiary dies.(c) Copies of the independent evidence 
described in subsection (b) and documents required by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 40-5009a, and 
amendments thereto, shall be submitted to the insurer when the viatical settlement provider 
submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by 
a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement provider that the copies are true and correct 
copies of the documents received by the viatical settlement provider. No provision in this section 
shall prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any policy.(d) If the 
viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner or insured's certification 
described in subsection (b) when provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of 
the policy or certificate to the viatical settlement provider, the copy shall be deemed to 
conclusively establish that the viatical settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this 
section and the insurer shall timely respond to the request. 
K.S.A. 40-5010 

Section 40-5011 - Same; requirements on advertising 
The purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous 
statements in the advertisement of viatical settlements and to assure the clear, truthful and 
adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations and exclusions of any viatical settlement 
contract. This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and 
standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical settlements to 
assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive or 
misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of viatical 
settlements through the advertising media and material used by viatical settlement licensees. 
(a) This section shall apply to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts or related products 
or services intended for dissemination in this state, including internet advertising viewed by 
persons located in this state. Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal 
regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal 
regulation wherever possible.(b) Every viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times 
maintain a system of control over the content, form and method of dissemination of all 
advertisements of its contracts, products and services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom 
written, created, designed or presented, shall be the responsibility of the viatical settlement 
licensee, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement. A system of 
control shall include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others 
authorized by the viatical settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of the 
requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by 
the viatical settlement licensee.(c) Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or 
by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract, 
product or service shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not 
have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity 
or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall 
impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average 
education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(d) The 
information required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, 
or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to 
be confusing or misleading.(1) An advertisement shall not omit material information or use 
words, phrases, statements, references or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, 
tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, 
loss covered, premium payable or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical 
settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, an 
offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement 
contract includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, shall not 
remedy misleading statements.(2) No advertisement shall use the name or title of a life insurance 
company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the 
insurer.(3) No advertisement shall state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death 
benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable or in any manner an incorrect or improper 
practice.(4) The words "free," "no cost," "without cost," "no additional cost," "at no extra cost" 
or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An 
advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is 
included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(5) Testimonials, appraisals or 

analysis used in advertisements must be genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be 
applicable to the viatical settlement contract, product or service advertised, if any; and be 
accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective 
viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis or endorsement. In using 
testimonials, appraisals or analysis, the viatical settlement licensee makes as its own all the 
statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this 
section.(A) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis or an endorsement has a 
financial interest in the viatical settlement provider or related entity as a stockholder, director, 
officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required 
union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(B) An 
advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract, benefit or service has 
been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization 
unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the viatical 
settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, 
controlled or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other 
consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, 
that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.(C) When an endorsement refers to benefits 
received under a viatical settlement contract, all pertinent information shall be retained for a 
period of five years after its use.(e) No advertisement shall contain statistical information unless 
it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an 
advertisement shall be identified.(f) No advertisement shall disparage insurers, viatical 
settlement providers, viatical settlement brokers, insurance producers, policies, services or 
methods of marketing.(g) The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be clearly identified 
in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract, products or services, 
and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical settlement contract shall 
be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is 
part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be shown on the 
application.(h) No advertisement shall use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent 
company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the viatical settlement 
licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or other device or reference without disclosing the name 
of the viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to 
mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee, or to create the 
impression that a company other than the viatical settlement licensee would have any 
responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract.(i) No 
advertisement shall use any combination of words, symbols or physical materials that by their 
content, phraseology, shape, color or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of 
words, symbols or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise 
appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the 
solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.(j) An 
advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the 
advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that 
competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the 
audience to consult the licensee's web site or contact the department of insurance to find out if 
the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker is licensed.(k) No advertisement shall create the impression that the viatical 
settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, 

desirability or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts are recommended or endorsed by 
any government entity.(l) The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its 
advertisements. No advertisement shall use a trade name, any group designation, name of any 
affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or other device in a 
manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of 
the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have 
any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(m) No advertisement shall, directly 
or indirectly, create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the United States 
government endorses, approves or favors:(1) Any viatical settlement licensee or its business 
practices or methods of operation;(2) the merits, desirability or advisability of any viatical 
settlement contract;(3) any viatical settlement contract; or(4) any life insurance policy or life 
insurance company.(n) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will 
occur, the advertising shall disclose the average time frame from completed application to the 
date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(o) If the 
advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the 
average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the 
licensee during the past six months.

Section 40-5012a - Same; violations; required notice provisions; notification of commissioner; 
availability of records to commissioner; sharing of records; conditions(a) No person 
shall:(1) Commit a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(2) Knowingly or intentionally interfere 
with the enforcement of any provision of this act or any investigation of suspected or actual 
violations of this act.(3) Knowingly or intentionally permit any person, employed by a person in 
the business of viatical settlements, convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust 
to participate in the business of viatical settlements. No person in the business of viatical 
settlements shall knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving 
dishonesty or breach of trust to participate in the business of viatical settlements.(4) Issue, solicit, 
market or otherwise promote the purchase of an insurance policy for the sole purpose of or with 
the primary emphasis on settling the policy.(5) Employ any device, scheme or artifice in 
violation of K.S.A. 40-450, and amendments thereto, in the solicitation, application or issuance 
of a life insurance policy.(6) Receive, when providing premium financing, any proceeds, fees or 
other consideration from the policy or owner of the policy that are in addition to the amounts 
required to pay the principal, interest and costs or expenses incurred by the lender or borrower 
related to policy premiums paid under the premium financing agreement, except for the event of 
a default unless either the default on such loan or the transfer of the policy in connection with 
such default occurs pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for the 
purpose of evading regulation under this act.(b)(1) Viatical settlements, contracts and 
applications for viatical settlements, regardless of the form of transmission, shall contain the 
following statement or a substantially similar statement: 
"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or viatical 
settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison." 
(2) The lack of a statement as required in paragraph (1) shall not constitute a defense in any 
prosecution for a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(c)(1) Any person engaged in the business of 
viatical settlements having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement 

act is being, will be or has been committed shall provide to the commissioner the information 
required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the commissioner.(2) Any other person having 
knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be or has 
been committed may provide to the commissioner the information required by, and in a manner 
prescribed by, the commissioner.(d)(1) No civil liability shall be imposed on and no cause of 
action shall arise from a person's furnishing information concerning suspected, anticipated or 
completed fraudulent viatical settlement acts or suspected or completed fraudulent insurance 
acts, if the information is provided to or received from:(A) The commissioner or the 
commissioner's employees, agents or representatives;(B) federal, state or local law enforcement 
or regulatory officials or their employees, agents or representatives;(C) any person involved in 
the prevention and detection of fraudulent viatical settlement acts or that person's agents, 
employees or representatives;(D) the NAIC, national association of securities dealers, the North 
American securities administrators association, or their employees, agents or representatives, or 
other regulatory body overseeing life insurance, viatical settlements, securities or investment 
fraud; or(E) the life insurer that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the 
insured.(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to statements made with actual malice. In an action 
brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a 
fraudulent viatical settlement act or a fraudulent insurance act, the party bringing the action shall 
plead specifically any allegation that paragraph (1) does not apply because the person filing the 
report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice.(3) A person identified in 
paragraph (1) shall be entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs if such person is the 
prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of
