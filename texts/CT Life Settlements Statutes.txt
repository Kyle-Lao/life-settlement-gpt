Section 38a-465e - Examination of licensees and applicants. Commissioner's access to records. 
Retention of records. Expenses of examination. Confidentiality of examination workpapers and 
reports(a) When the commissioner deems it reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the 
public, the commissioner may examine the business and affairs of any licensee or applicant for a 
license. The commissioner may order any licensee or applicant to produce any records, books, 
files or other information reasonably necessary to ascertain whether such licensee or applicant is 
acting or acted in violation of the law or is otherwise contrary to the interests of the public. The 
licensee or applicant shall pay all expenses incurred by the commissioner in conducting any 
examination.(b) Providers shall maintain records of each consummated transaction and life 
settlement contracts and, subject to the provisions of section 38a-465d, such records shall be 
available, during reasonable business hours, to the commissioner for inspection for the three-year 
period following the insured's death.(c) In lieu of an examination under this part of any foreign 
or alien licensee licensed in this state, the commissioner may accept an examination report on the 
licensee as prepared by the commissioner for the licensee's state of domicile or port-of-entry 
state.(d) Names and individual identification data of owners and insureds shall be considered 
private and confidential information and shall not be disclosed by the commissioner unless 
required by law.(e)(1) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the 
commissioner shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform 
such examination and instructing them as to its scope. In conducting the examination, the 
examiner shall use methods common to the examination of any life settlement licensee and shall 
use guidelines and procedures set forth in an examiners' handbook adopted by a national 
organization.(2) Each licensee or person from whom information is sought, its officers, directors 
and agents shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient and free access at all reasonable 
hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, workpapers, documents, assets and computer 
or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business and affairs of the licensee being 
examined. The officers, directors, employees and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate 
the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal by a 
licensee or its officers, directors, employees or agents to submit to an examination or to comply 
with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for suspension, refusal 
or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in the life settlement 
business or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for 
suspension, revocation or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to 
sections 38a-17 to 38a-19, inclusive.(3) The commissioner shall have the power to issue 
subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the 
examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may 
petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order 
compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.(4) When making 
an examination under this part, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent 
actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as 
examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the 
examination.(5) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the commissioner's 
authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory 
action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made 
pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory 
action.(6) All final or preliminary examination reports, examiner or licensee workpapers or other 
documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of an 

examination shall be kept confidential, pursuant to section 38a-69a.(f)(1) Examination reports 
shall be comprised of only facts appearing upon the books, from the testimony of the licensee, its 
officers or agents or other persons examined concerning its affairs, and such conclusions and 
recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.(2) Not later than 
sixty days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the 
commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified 
report, the commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a 
notice that shall afford the licensee examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty 
days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the 
examination report and which shall become part of the report, or to request a hearing on any 
matter in dispute.(3) In the event the commissioner determines that regulatory action is 
appropriate as a result of an examination, the commissioner may initiate any proceedings or 
actions provided by law.(g) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all examination reports, 
workpapers, recorded information, documents and copies thereof produced by, obtained by or 
disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made under 
this section, or in the course of analysis or investigation by the commissioner of the financial 
condition or market conduct of a licensee, shall be confidential by law and privileged and shall 
not be subject to section 1-210, subject to subpoena, or subject to discovery or be admissible in 
evidence in any civil action. The commissioner is authorized to use the documents, materials or 
other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the 
commissioner's official duties. The licensee being examined shall have access to all documents 
used to make the report.(h)(1) An examiner shall not be appointed by the commissioner if the 
examiner, directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest, is affiliated with the management of or 
owns a pecuniary interest in any person subject to examination under this section. This section 
shall not be construed to automatically preclude an examiner from being (A) an owner, (B) an 
insured in a life settlement contract or insurance policy, or (C) a beneficiary in an insurance 
policy that is proposed for a life settlement contract.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this 
subsection, the commissioner may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified 
actuaries, certified public accountants or other similar individuals who are independently 
practicing their professions, even though these persons may from time to time be similarly 
employed or retained by persons subject to examination under this section.(i)(1) No cause of 
action shall arise or any liability be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner's 
authorized representatives or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for any statements 
made or conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this section.(2) No 
cause of action shall arise or any liability be imposed against any person for communicating or 
delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized 
representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this section, if such 
communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the 
intent to deceive. This subdivision shall not abrogate or modify any common law or statutory 
privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in subdivision (1) of this 
subsection.(3) A person identified in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection shall be entitled to 
an award of attorney's fees and costs if such person is the prevailing party in a civil action for 
libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of 
this section and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For the 
purpose of this section, a proceeding is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law 
or fact at the time that it was initiated.(j) The commissioner may investigate suspected fraudulent 

life settlement acts, as specified in section 38a-465j, and persons engaged in the business of life 
settlements.

solicited or obtained by a provider or broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or 
the identity of family members, a spouse or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to

provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be 
provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked 
to renew your permission to share information every two years." The written disclosures shall be 
provided in a separate document that is signed by the owner and the provider and shall provide at 
least the following disclosures:(1) That there are possible alternatives to life settlement contracts 
including, but not limited to, accelerated death benefits offered by the issuer of the life insurance 
policy;(2) That some or all of the proceeds of a life settlement contract may be taxable, and 
assistance should be sought from a professional tax advisor;(3) That receipt of the life settlement 
contract proceeds may adversely affect the recipient's eligibility for public assistance or other 
government benefits or entitlements, and advice should be obtained from the appropriate 
agencies;(4) That the owner has the right to rescind a life settlement contract for fifteen calendar 
days after the date such contract is executed by all parties and the owner has received the 
disclosures specified herein. Such rescission exercised by the owner shall be effective only if 
both notice of rescission is given to the provider and the owner repays all proceeds and any 
premiums, loans and loan interest paid by the provider within the rescission period. If the insured 
dies during the rescission period, the settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, 
subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans 
and loan interest to the provider;(5) That proceeds from the life settlement contract may be 
subject to the claims of creditors;(6) That proceeds will be sent to the owner within three 
business days after the provider has received the insurer or group administrator's 
acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred 
and the beneficiary has been designated in accordance with the terms of the life settlement 
contract;(7) That entering into a life settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, 
including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or 
certificate, to be forfeited by the owner, and assistance should be sought from a financial 
advisor;(8) That the insured may be contacted by either the provider or broker or its authorized 
representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status or to verify the insured's 
address. This contact is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of 
more than one year, and no more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one 
year or less;(9) The amount and method of calculating the compensation paid or to be paid to the 
broker or to any other person acting for the owner in connection with the transaction, wherein the

will be available to the owner and the transmitter of the funds;(11) That the commissioner shall 
require delivery of a buyer's guide or a similar consumer advisory package in the form prescribed 
by the commissioner to owners during the solicitation process;(12) That the commissioner shall 

require providers and brokers to print separate, signed fraud warnings on their applications and

information in an application for insurance or life settlement contract is guilty of a crime and 
may be subject to fines and confinement in prison.";(13) The affiliation, if any, between the 
provider and the issuer of the insurance policy to be settled;(14) That a broker represents the 
owner exclusively, and not the insurer, the provider or any other person, and owes a fiduciary 
duty to the owner, including a duty to act according to the owner's instructions and in the best 
interest of the owner;(15) The name, address and telephone number of the provider;(16) The 
name, business address and telephone number of the independent third-party escrow agent, and 
the fact that the owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements 
or documents; and(17) That a change of ownership could limit the insured's ability to purchase 
future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will 
issue on one life.(b) The written disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in any life 
settlement contract furnished to an owner by a provider, including any affiliations or contractual 
arrangements between the provider and the broker. Failure to provide the disclosures or rights set

Conn. Gen. Stat. § 38a-465f 
Section 38a-465g - Prerequisites to a life settlement contract wherein insured is terminally or 
chronically ill. Medical release and confidentiality of medical information. Verification of 
coverage. Notice to insurer. Change of ownership or beneficiary. Rescission. Escrow agent or 
trustee. Broker fee calculation and disclosure of compensation. Prohibitions. 
Exemptions(a) Before entering into a life settlement contract with any owner of a policy wherein 
the insured is terminally ill or chronically ill, a provider shall obtain:(1) If the owner is the 
insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician, physician assistant or advanced 
practice registered nurse that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue 
influence to enter into the settlement contract; and(2) A document in which the insured consents 
to the release of the insured's medical records to a provider, broker or insurance producer, and, if 
the policy was issued less than two years from the date of application for a settlement contract, to 
the insurance company that issued the policy.(b) The insurer shall respond to a request for 

verification of coverage submitted by a provider, broker or life insurance producer on a form 
approved by the commissioner not later than thirty calendar days after the date the request was 
received. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which 
respects it is unable to respond. In its response, the insurer shall indicate whether, based on the 
medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation 
regarding the validity of the policy.(c) Prior to or at the time of execution of the settlement 
contract, the provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the 
settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the 
settlement contract, that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the 
policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering into the settlement contract freely and 
voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the 
insured has a terminal or chronic illness or condition and that the terminal or chronic illness or 
condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.(d) If a broker or life 
insurance producer performs any of the activities required of the provider under this section, the 
provider shall be deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.(e) The insurer shall 
not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement 
contract lawfully entered into in this state or with a resident of this state.(f) Not later than twenty 
days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall give written notice to 
the insurer that issued the policy that the policy has become subject to a life settlement contract. 
The notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the medical records release required under 
subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section and a copy of the insured's application for the life 
settlement contract.(g) All medical information solicited or obtained by any person licensed 
pursuant to this part shall be subject to applicable provisions of law relating to the confidentiality 
of medical information.(h) Each life settlement contract entered into in this state shall provide 
that the owner may rescind the contract not later than fifteen days from the date it is executed by 
all parties thereto. Such rescission exercised by the owner shall be effective only if both notice of 
rescission is given to the provider and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans 
and loan interest paid by the provider within the rescission period. A failure to provide written 
notice of the right of rescission shall toll the period of such right until thirty days after the written 
notice of the right of rescission has been given. If the insured dies during the rescission period, 
the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment by the owner or the 
owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest to the provider.(i) Not 
later than three business days after the date the provider receives the documents from the owner 
to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the 
settlement into an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or 
federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. Not later than three business days after receiving acknowledgment of the 
transfer of the insurance policy from the issuer of the policy, said trustee or escrow agent shall 
pay the settlement proceeds to the owner.(j) Failure to tender the life settlement contract 
proceeds to the owner within the time set forth in section 38a-465f shall render the viatical 
settlement contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time such 
consideration is tendered to, and accepted by, the owner.(k) Any fee paid by a provider, party, 
individual or an owner to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a 
life settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained and not as a 
percentage of the face value of the policy. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a 
broker from reducing such broker's fee below such percentage.(l) Each broker shall disclose to 

the owner anything of value paid or given to such broker in connection with a life settlement 
contract concerning the owner.(m) No person at any time prior to, or at the time of, the 
application for or issuance of a policy, or during a two-year period commencing with the date of 
issuance of the policy, shall enter into a life settlement contract regardless of the date the 
compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, 
bequest or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition shall not apply if the owner 
certifies to the provider that:(1) The policy was issued upon the owner's exercise of conversion 
rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided the total of the time covered under the 
conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is not less than twenty-four 
months. The time covered under a group policy shall be calculated without regard to a change in 
insurance carriers, provided the coverage has been continuous and under the same group 
sponsorship; or(2) The owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of 
the following conditions have been met within said two-year period:(A) The owner or insured is 
terminally ill or chronically ill;(B) the owner or insured disposes of the owner or insured's 
ownership interests in a closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other 
similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued;(C) the owner's 
spouse dies;(D) the owner divorces his or her spouse;(E) the owner retires from full-time 
employment;(F) the owner has a physical or mental disability and a physician, a physician 
assistant or an advanced practice registered nurse determines that the disability prevents the 
owner from maintaining full-time employment; or(G) a final order, judgment or decree is entered 
by a court of competent jurisdiction on the application of a creditor of the owner, adjudicating 
the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or 
appointing a receiver, trustee or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's 
assets.(n) Copies of the independent evidence required by subdivision (2) of subsection (m) of 
this section shall be submitted to the insurer when the provider submits a request to the insurer 
for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the 
provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider. 
Nothing in this section shall prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of 
any policy.(o) If, at the time the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of 
the policy to the provider, the provider submits a copy of independent evidence of subparagraph 
(A) of subdivision (2) of subsection (m) of this section, such copy shall be deemed to establish 
that the settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section. 
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 38a-465g 
 
Section 38a-465h - Premium finance loans. Disclosures and certifications(a) Without limiting the 
ability of an insurer to assess the insurability of a policy applicant and in addition to other 
questions an insurance company may lawfully pose to a life insurance applicant, an insurance 
company may inquire in the application for life insurance whether the proposed owner intends to 
pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will use the policy as collateral 
to support the financing.(b) If, as described in subdivision (11) of section 38a-465, the loan 
provides funds that can be used for a purpose other than paying for the premiums, costs and 
expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the life insurance policy and loan, the 
application shall be rejected as a violation of section 38a-465i.(c) If the financing does not 
violate section 38a-465i in this manner, the insurance company:(1) May make disclosures 
including, but not limited to, the following, to the applicant and the insured, in the application or 

an amendment to the application completed not later than the delivery of the policy: "If you have 
entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral and the policy does change 
ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the following may be true:(A) A 
change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;(B) a change 
of ownership could limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the insured's life because 
there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life;(C) should there be a change 
of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage on the insured's life in the future, 
the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status or other factors may reduce the ability to 
obtain coverage or may result in significantly higher premiums; and(D) you should consult a 
professional advisor, since a change in ownership in satisfaction of the loan may result in tax 
consequences to the owner, depending on the structure of the loan."; and(2) May require the 
applicant or the insured to certify that:(A) Such applicant or insured has not entered into any 
agreement or arrangement providing for the future sale of such life insurance policy;(B) The loan 
arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for partial or full payment of the 
premiums, costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining such life insurance 
policy, and that such applicant or insured has not entered into any agreement by which such 
applicant or insured will receive consideration in exchange for procuring such policy; 
and(C) The borrower has an insurable interest in the insured. 
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 38a-465h 
Section 38a-465i - Violations(a) It shall be a violation of this part for any person to:(1) Enter into 
a life settlement contract if such person knows or reasonably should have known that the life 
insurance policy was obtained by means of a false, deceptive or misleading application for such 
policy;(2) Engage in any transaction, practice or course of business if such person knows or 
reasonably should have known that the intent was to avoid the notice requirements of this 
section;(3) Engage in any fraudulent act or practice in connection with any transaction relating to 
any settlement involving an owner who is a resident of this state;(4) Issue, solicit, market or 
otherwise promote the purchase of an insurance policy for the purpose of or with the emphasis 
on settling the policy;(5) Receive, if providing premium financing, any proceeds, fees or other 
consideration from the policy or policy owner that are in addition to the amounts required to pay 
principal, interest or any costs or expenses, which are reasonable in type and amount, incurred by 
the lender or borrower in connection with such premium finance agreement, except in the event 
of a default, provided neither default on such loan nor the transfer of the policy, in connection 
with such default, is pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for the 
purpose of evading regulation under this part. Any payments, charges, fees or other amounts 
received by a person or entity providing premium financing in violation of this subdivision shall 
be remitted to the original owner of the policy or to such owner's estate if said original owner is 
not living at the time of the determination of the overpayment;(6) With respect to any settlement 
contract or insurance policy and a broker, to knowingly solicit an offer from, effectuate a life 
settlement contract with or make a sale to any provider, financing entity or related provider trust 
that is controlling, controlled by or under common control with such broker, unless such 
relationship is disclosed to the owner;(7) With respect to any life settlement contract or insurance 
policy and a provider, to knowingly enter into a life settlement contract with an owner if, in 
connection with such life settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a broker that is 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with such provider, financing entity or 
related provider trust that is involved in such settlement contract, unless such relationship is 

disclosed to the owner;(8) With respect to a provider, to enter into a life settlement contract 
unless the life settlement promotional, advertising and marketing materials, as may be prescribed 
by regulation, have been filed with the commissioner. In no event shall any marketing materials 
expressly reference that the insurance is free for any period of time. The inclusion of any 
reference in the marketing materials that would cause an owner to reasonably believe the 
insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation of this part; or(9) With 
respect to any life insurance producer, insurance company, broker or provider, to make any 
statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or 
financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the 
policyholder for any period of time unless so provided in the policy.(b) A violation of this 
section shall be deemed a fraudulent life settlement act, as specified in section 38a-465j.

life insurance;(ii) Where the request for disclosure has been asked for by the insurer, failing to

defraud, enter into, broker or otherwise deal in a life settlement contract, the subject of which is a 
life insurance policy that was obtained by presenting false information concerning any fact

concerning any fact material to the policy, where the owner or the owner's agent intended to 
defraud the policy's issuer;(vii) Attempt to commit, assist, aid or abet in the commission of, or

or investigations or suspected or actual violations of this part.(c) A person in the business of life 
settlements shall not knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony

confinement in prison."(2) The lack of a statement as required in subdivision (1) of this 
subsection shall not constitute a defense in any prosecution for a fraudulent life settlement 
act.(e)(1) Any person engaged in the business of life settlements having knowledge or a 
reasonable belief that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, will be or has been committed 
shall provide to the commissioner the information required by, and in a manner prescribed by,

to statements made with actual malice. In an action brought against a person for filing a report or 
furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent life settlement act or a fraudulent insurance 
act, the party bringing the action shall plead specifically any allegation that subdivision (1) of 
this subsection does not apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information 
did so with actual malice.(3) A person identified in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be

to enforce laws administered by the commissioner;(B) to federal, state or local law enforcement 
or regulatory agencies, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting and preventing

records required if the transactions were executed in the owner's state of residence. The forms 
used in such states need not be approved by the commissioner.(h) If there is a conflict in the laws 
that apply to an owner and a provider in any individual transaction, the laws of the state that
