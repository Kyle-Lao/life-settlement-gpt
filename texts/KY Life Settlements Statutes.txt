Section 304.15-702 - Permitted questioning of life insurance applicant concerning financing of 
premium payments(1) In addition to other questions an insurer may lawfully pose to a life 
insurance applicant, insurers may inquire in the application for insurance whether the proposed 
owner intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will use the 
policy as collateral to support the financing.(a) If, as described in KRS 304.15-020(17), the loan 
provides funds which can be used for a purpose other than paying for the premiums, costs, and 
expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the life insurance policy and loan, the 
application shall be rejected as a violation of the prohibited practices in KRS 304.15-717.(b) If 
the financing does not violate KRS 304.15-717 in this manner, the insurer:1. May make 
disclosures to the applicant and the insured, either on the application or an amendment to the 
application to be completed no later than the delivery of the policy, which shall include but not 
be limited to the following statement or a substantially similar statement: 
"If you have entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral, and the 
policy does change ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the 
following may be true: 
a. A change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;b. A 
change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the 
insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one (1) 
life;c. Should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage on 
the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, or other 
factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage and may result in significantly higher 
premiums; andd. You should consult a professional advisor, since a change in ownership in 
satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure 
of the loan."; and2. May require certifications from the applicant or the insured or both which 
shall include but not be limited to the following statement or a substantially similar statement: 
"I certify that: 

a. I have not entered into any agreement or arrangement providing for the future sale of this life 
insurance policy;b. My loan arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for 
some or all of the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining my 
life insurance policy, but I have not entered into any agreement by which I am to receive 
consideration in exchange for procuring this policy; andc. The borrower has an insurable interest 
in the insured."

created, whichever shall occur last.(c) This section shall not relieve a licensed settlement 
provider of the obligation to produce these documents to the commissioner after the retention 
period has expired if the settlement provider has retained the documents.(d) Records required to 
be retained by this section shall be legible and complete and may be retained in paper, 
photograph, microprocess, magnetic, mechanical, or electronic media, or by any process that

provider shall provide in writing, in a separate document that is signed by the owner and 
provider the information in this subsection to the owner no later than the date the life settlement 
contract is signed by all parties. The written disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in any 
life settlement contract or in a separate document furnished to the owner by a provider including

provide the following information:(a) That there are possible alternatives to life settlement 
contracts including but not limited to accelerated benefits or policy loans offered under the

federal income tax laws and state franchise and income tax laws, and that assistance should be 
sought from a personal tax advisor;(c) That proceeds of the life settlement contract could be 
subject to the claims of creditors;(d) That receipt of the proceeds of a life settlement contract 
may adversely affect the owner's eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits or

thirty (30) calendar days of the date it is executed by all parties or fifteen (15) calendar days after 
the receipt of the proceeds of the life settlement contract by the owner. If exercised by the owner, 
rescission is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given, and within the rescission 
period all proceeds, and any premiums, loans, and loan interest are repaid to the settlement 
provider. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the settlement contract shall be deemed 
to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all life settlement proceeds and any premiums, 
loans, and loan interest to the life settlement provider. The life settlement provider shall 
effectuate the change of ownership of the policy or certificate to the owner immediately upon 
effective rescission by the owner;(f) That entering into a life settlement contract may cause other 
rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist 
under the policy, to be forfeited by the owner and that assistance should be sought from a 
financial adviser;(g) That funds will be sent to the owner within three (3) business days after the 
life settlement provider has received the insurer's or group administrator's acknowledgment that 
ownership of the policy has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated pursuant to 
the life settlement contract;(h) That the disclosure document shall contain the following 
language: 
"All medical, financial, or personal information solicited or obtained by a life settlement provider 
or life settlement broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or the identity of 

family members, a spouse, or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life 
settlement between the owner and the life settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this 
information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to 
someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew 
your permission to share information every two (2) years."; and 
(i) That the insured may be contacted by the life settlement provider or its authorized 
representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status or to verify the insured's 
address. This contact shall be limited to once every three (3) months if the insured has a life 
expectancy of more than one (1) year, and no more than once per month if the insured has a life 
expectancy of one (1) year or less.(2) A life settlement provider shall provide the owner with at 
least the following disclosures no later than the date the life settlement contract is signed by all 
parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in the life settlement contract or in a 
separate document signed by the owner and the life settlement provider and provide the 
following information:(a) State the affiliation, if any, between the life settlement provider and 
the issuer of the policy to be acquired pursuant to a settlement contract;(b) State the name, 
address and telephone number of the life settlement provider;(c) If a policy to be acquired

lives and shall be advised to consult with his insurance producer or the company issuing the 
policy for advice on the proposed life settlement contract;(d) State the dollar amount of the

owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or 
documents;(f) The date by which the funds will be available to the owner and the transmitter of 
the funds;(g) That a consumer guide shall be delivered to owners with each application as 
required in this subsection;(h) That applications and life settlement contracts shall contain the 
statement as required in KRS 304.15-717(2);(i) That a broker represents exclusively the owner, 
and not the insurer or the provider or any other person, and owes a fiduciary duty to the owner, 
including a duty to act according to the owner's instructions and in the best interests of the 
owner; and(j) The fact that a change in ownership could in the future limit the insured's ability to 
purchase future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage 
insurers will issue on one (1) life.(3) If the life settlement provider transfers ownership or 
changes the beneficiary of the policy, the life settlement provider shall communicate the change 
in ownership or beneficiary to the insured within twenty (20) days after the change.(4) A broker

broker who receives compensation and the amount of compensation received by the broker, 

which compensation includes anything of value paid or given to the broker in connection with 
the life settlement contract;(d) A complete reconciliation of the gross offer or bid by the provider

paragraph, "gross offer or bid" means the total amount or value offered by the provider for the 
purchase of one (1) or more life insurance policies, inclusive of the commissions and fees; 
and(e) The failure to provide the disclosures or rights described in this section shall be deemed 
an unfair trade practice. 
KRS 304.15-710 
Section 304.15-712 - Permitted and prohibited life insurance advertising and marketing(1) A 
broker or provider licensed pursuant to KRS 304.15-700 to 304.15-720 may conduct or 
participate in advertisements within this state. Such advertisements shall comply with all 
advertising and marketing laws of this chapter or rules and administrative regulations 
promulgated by the commissioner that are applicable to life insurers or to brokers, and providers 
licensed pursuant to this chapter.(2) Advertisements shall be accurate, truthful, and not 
misleading in fact or by implication.(3) No person or trust shall:(a) Directly or indirectly market, 
advertise, solicit, or otherwise promote the purchase of a life insurance policy for the sole 
purpose of, or with a primary emphasis on, settling the policy; or(b) Except as provided in KRS 
304.12-092, use the words "free," "no cost," or words of similar import in the marketing, 
advertising, soliciting, or otherwise promoting the purchase of a life insurance policy. 
KRS 304.15-712 
Section 304.15-715 - Requirements for life settlement contracts(1) A life settlement provider 
entering into a life settlement contract with any person shall first obtain:(a) If the owner is 
insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of sound mind 
and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a life settlement contract; and(b) A 
document in which the insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a life 
settlement provider, life insurance agent, or life settlement broker and, if the policy was issued 
less than two (2) years from the date of application for a life settlement contract, to the insurance 
company that issued the policy.(2) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of 
coverage submitted by a life settlement provider or life settlement broker not later than thirty 
(30) calendar days after the date the request is received. The request for verification of coverage 
shall be made on a form approved by the commissioner. The insurer shall complete and issue the 
verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In its response, the 
insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the 
insurer intends to pursue an investigation at that time regarding the validity of the insurance 
contract or possible fraud, and shall provide sufficient detail of all reasons for the investigation to 
the life settlement provider or life settlement broker.(3) Prior to or at the time of execution of the 
life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which 
the owner consents to the life settlement contract, represents that he or she has a full and 
complete understanding of the life settlement contract and a full and complete understanding of 
the benefits of the policy, and acknowledges that he or she has entered into the life settlement 
contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, 
that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.(4) All 
medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable 
provision of state law relating to confidentiality of medical information.(5) All life settlement 

contracts entered into in this state shall contain an unconditional right to rescind a life settlement 
contract before the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days after the date it is executed or fifteen (15) 
calendar days after the date of receipt of the proceeds of the life settlement contract by the 
owner. If exercised by the owner, rescission is effective only if both notice of the rescission is 
given, and within the rescission period all proceeds, and any premiums, loans, and loan interest 
are repaid to the life settlement provider. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life 
settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment of all proceeds 
and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the life settlement provider. The life settlement 
provider shall effectuate the change of ownership of the policy or certificate to the owner 
immediately upon effective rescission by the owner.(6) The independent third-party trustee shall 
transfer the proceeds that are due to the owner within two (2) business days upon receipt of 
acknowledgment of the transfer of ownership from the insurer.(7) Failure to tender consideration 
to the owner for the life settlement contract by the date disclosed renders the life settlement 
contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered 
to and accepted by the owner.(8) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the 
health status of the insured after the execution of the life settlement contract shall only be made 
by the life settlement provider or its authorized representative and shall be limited to once every 
three (3) months for an insured with a life expectancy of more than one (1) year, and to no more 
than once per month for an insured with a life expectancy of one (1) year or less. The life 
settlement provider shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the life settlement 
contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to any contacts 
with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. Life settlement 
providers shall be responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives.(9) The insurer 
shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life 
settlement contract lawfully entered into in the Commonwealth or with a resident of the 
Commonwealth.(10) If a life settlement broker performs any activities required of the provider 
under this section, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled those requirements of this section that 
have been properly performed by the broker.(11) If a life settlement broker performs any of the 
disclosure activities required of the provider under KRS 304.15-710, the provider is deemed to 
have fulfilled those requirements of KRS 304.15-710 that have been properly performed by the 
broker.(12) Within twenty (20) days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the 
provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy 
has become subject to a life settlement contract. The notice shall be accompanied by the 
documents required by KRS 304.15-702(1)(b).(13) Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual, 
or an owner to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life 
settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of 
the policy. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a broker from reducing such 
broker's fee below this percentage if the broker so chooses.(14) The broker shall disclose to the 
owner anything of value paid or given to a broker which relates to a life settlement contract. 
KRS 304.15-715 
Section 304.15-716 - Violation due to time of contract - Conditions - Procedure - Satisfaction of 
requirements(1) It is a violation of this subtitle for a person to enter into a life settlement contract

year period commencing with the date of issuance of the policy unless the owner certifies to the 
life settlement provider that one (1) or more of the following conditions has been met within the 

two (2) year period:(a) The policy was issued upon the owner's exercise of conversion rights 
arising out of a group or individual policy, if the total of the time covered under the conversion

if the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship; or(b) The owner 
submits independent evidence to the life settlement provider that one (1) or more of the 
following conditions has been met within the two (2) year period:1. The owner or insured is 
terminally or chronically ill;2. The owner or insured disposes of his ownership interests in a 
closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at 
the time the insurance policy was initially issued;3. The owner's spouse dies;4. The owner 
divorces his or her spouse;5. The owner retires from full-time employment;6. The owner 
becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines that the disability prevents 
the owner from maintaining full-time employment; or7. A final order, judgment, or decree is 
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of the creditor of the owner, 
adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of 
the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's 
assets.(2) Copies of the independent evidence described in subsection (1) of this section and the 
documents required by KRS 304.15-710 shall be submitted to the insurer when the life 
settlement provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall 
be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the life settlement provider that the copies are true 
and correct copies of the documents received by the life settlement provider.(3) If the life 
settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided for in 
subsection (2) of this section when the life settlement provider submits a request to the insurer to 
effect the transfer of the policy to the life settlement provider, the copy shall be deemed to 
conclusively establish that the life settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section 
and the insurer shall respond timely to the request.

Required statement regarding false information - Furnishing information regarding fraudulent

person is acting as a life settlement provider in the same life settlement contract;(g) For any

act or practice in connection with any transaction relating to any settlement involving an owner

with such broker unless disclosed to the owner;(m) With respect to any life settlement contract 
or life insurance policy and a provider, to knowingly enter into a life settlement contract with an

settlement contract unless the life settlement promotional, advertising, and marketing materials, 
as may be prescribed by administrative regulation, have been filed with the commissioner. 
Marketing materials shall not expressly reference that the insurance is "free" for any period of 
time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause an owner to 
reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation 
of KRS 304.15-700 to 304.15-720;(o) With respect to any insurance company, insurance 
producer, broker, or provider, or any other person, to make any statement or representation to the

and the effect of the statement is not misrepresented. 
(2) A life settlement contract and an application for a life settlement contract, regardless of the 
form of transmission, shall contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement: 
"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or life 
settlement contract is guilty of a crime and upon conviction may be subject to fines or 
confinement in prison, or both." 
The lack of a statement required by this section does not constitute a defense in any prosecution 
for a fraudulent life settlement act. 
(3)(a) A person engaged in the business of life settlements who has knowledge or a reasonable 
belief that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, will be, or has been committed shall provide 

the information required to the commissioner, in a manner prescribed by the

action brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a 
fraudulent life settlement act or a fraudulent insurance act, the party bringing the action shall 
plead specifically any allegation that this subsection shall not apply because the person filing the 
report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice.(c) A person who furnishes 
information concerning fraudulent life settlement acts and who is a party in a civil cause of 
action for libel, slander, or another relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the 
provisions of this chapter shall be entitled to an award of attorney's fees and court costs if he is 
the prevailing party in the suit and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in 
filing the cause of action. For purposes of this paragraph, a proceeding is "substantially justified"

immunities enjoyed by a person.(e) This subsection shall not apply to a person who furnishes

confidential and shall not be a public record and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in 
a civil or criminal action, except that:(a) This subsection shall not prohibit release by the 
commissioner of documents and evidence obtained in an investigation of suspected or actual 
fraudulent life settlement acts:1. In administrative or judicial proceedings to enforce laws 
administered by the commissioner;2. To federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory 
agencies, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraudulent

provided by paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not abrogate or modify the privilege granted

the Department of Insurance;(c) Limit the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to

law and to take appropriate action against wrongdoers; or(d) Preempt, supersede, or limit any

a licensee requests, may grant modifications of the required initiatives listed in this subsection as 
necessary to ensure an effective antifraud program. The modifications may be more or less 
restrictive than the required initiatives so long as the modifications reasonably may be expected 
to accomplish the purpose of this section. Antifraud initiatives shall include the

independent contractors of those life settlement providers; and(b) An antifraud plan that shall be
