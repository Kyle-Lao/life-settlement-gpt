as the consumer complaints, results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in 
management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public 
accountants, and other relevant criteria as determined by the commissioner.b. For purposes of

is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the examination of the 
licensee.c. In lieu of an examination under this chapter of any foreign or alien licensee licensed 
in this state, the commissioner may, at the commissioner's discretion, accept an examination 
report on the licensee as prepared by the commissioner for the licensee's state of domicile or 
port-of-entry state.d. As far as practical, the examination of a foreign or alien licensee shall be

agreement, whichever is later.(2) All checks, drafts, or other evidence and documentation related 
to the payment, transfer, deposit, or release of funds from the date of the transaction.(3) All other 
records and documents related to the requirements of this chapter.b. This section does not relieve 
a person of the obligation to produce documents described in paragraph "a" to the commissioner 
after the retention period has expired if the person has retained the documents.c. Records 
required to be retained by paragraph "a" must be legible and complete and may be retained in 
paper, photograph, microprocess, magnetic, mechanical, or electronic media, or by any process 
that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for the reproduction of a record.3.Conduct 
of examinations.a. Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the 
commissioner shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform 

the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the 
examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the 
examiners handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners. The 
commissioner may also adopt rules for such other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner 
may deem appropriate.b. Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, its officers, 
directors, and agents shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and free access at all

being examined. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or person shall 
facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The 
refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to examination or 
to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for 
suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of, any license or authority held by the licensee to 
engage in the viatical settlement business or other business subject to the commissioner's 
jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of any license or authority 
shall be conducted pursuant to section 507B.6A.c. The commissioner shall have the power to

may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary 
evidence. A failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court.d. When 
making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, 
independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and 
specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the 
subject of the examination.e. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the 
commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or 
regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions 
made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory 
action.f. The commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or

proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical 
settlement provider or purchaser within sixty days of the insured's death.g. Funds will be sent to

insurer's or group administrator's written acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or 
interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated.h. Entering

limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, 
and no more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less. All 
such contacts shall be made only by a duly licensed viatical settlement provider or by the 
authorized representative of a duly licensed viatical settlement provider.2. A viatical settlement 
provider shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the

benefits under the policy or certificate, and the extent to which the viator's interest in those 
benefits will be transferred as a result of the viatical settlement contract.e. Whether the funds will 
be escrowed with an independent third party during the transfer process, and if so, provide the 
name, business address, and telephone number of the independent third-party escrow agent, and 
the fact that the viator or owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust 
agreements or documents.3. A viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator with at least the 
following disclosures no later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all 
parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in the viatical settlement contract or in 
a separate document signed by the viator and provide all of the following information:a. The 
name, business address, and telephone number of the viatical settlement broker.b. A full, 
complete, and accurate description of all offers, counteroffers, acceptances, and rejections

transfers ownership or changes the beneficiary of the insurance policy, the viatical settlement 
provider shall communicate in writing the change in ownership or beneficiary to the insured 

within twenty days after the change.5. A viatical settlement provider shall provide the viatical 
settlement purchaser with at least the following disclosures prior to the date the viatical 
settlement purchase agreement is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously 
displayed in any viatical purchase contract or in a separate document signed by the viatical 
settlement purchaser and viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement investment agent, and 
shall make the following disclosure to the viatical settlement purchaser:a. The viatical settlement 
purchaser will receive no returns including dividends and interest, until the insured dies and a 
death claim payment is made.b. The actual annual rate of return on a viatical settlement contract 
is dependent upon an accurate projection of the insured's life expectancy, and the actual date of 
the insured's death. An annual "guaranteed" rate of return is not determinable.c. The viaticated 
life insurance contract should not be considered a liquid purchase since it is impossible to predict 
the exact timing of its maturity and the funds probably are not available until the death of the 
insured. There is no established secondary market for resale of these products by the viatical 
settlement purchaser.d. The viatical settlement purchaser may lose all benefits or may receive

be null and void.j. That group policies may contain limitations or caps in the conversion rights, 
that additional premiums may have to be paid if the policy is converted, the name of the party 
responsible for the payment of the additional premiums, and, if a group policy is terminated and 
replaced by another group policy, that there may be no right to convert the original 
coverage.k. The risks associated with policy contestability including but not limited to the risk 
that the viatical settlement purchaser will have no claim or only a partial claim to death benefits 
should the insurer rescind the policy within the contestability period.l. Whether the viatical 
settlement purchaser will be the owner of the policy in addition to being the beneficiary, and if 
the viatical settlement purchaser is the beneficiary only and not also the owner, the special risks 
associated with that status, including but not limited to the risk that the beneficiary may be 
changed or the premium may not be paid.m. The experience and qualifications of the person who 
determines the life expectancy of the insured, including in-house staff, independent physicians, 
and specialty firms that weigh medical and actuarial data; the information this projection is based 
on; and the relationship of the projection maker to the viatical settlement provider, if any.n. A 
brochure describing the process of investment in viatical settlements. The national association of 
insurance commissioners form for the brochure shall be used unless another form is developed

purchaser:a. All the life expectancy certifications obtained by the provider in the process of

the policy have been escrowed. If escrowed, state the date upon which the escrowed funds will 
be depleted and whether the viatical settlement purchaser will be responsible for payment of 
premiums thereafter and, if so, the amount of the premiums.c. Whether premium payments or 
other costs related to the policy have been waived. If waived, disclose whether the viatical 
settlement purchaser will be responsible for payment of the premiums if the insurer that wrote 
the policy terminates the waiver after purchase and the amount of those premiums.d. The type of 
policy offered or sold, i.e., whole life, term life, universal life, or a group policy certificate, any 
additional benefits contained in the policy, and the current status of the policy.e. If the policy is 
term insurance, the special risks associated with term insurance including but not limited to the 
viatical settlement purchaser's responsibility for additional premiums if the viator continues the 
term policy at the end of the current term.f. Whether the policy is contestable.g. Whether the 
insurer that wrote the policy has any additional rights that could negatively affect or extinguish 
the viatical settlement purchaser's rights under the viatical settlement contract, what these rights 
are, and under what conditions these rights are activated.h. The name and address of the person 
responsible for monitoring the insured's condition. The viatical settlement provider shall describe

Section 508E.9 - Disclosure to insurer 
A viatical settlement broker, or viatical settlement provider, shall fully disclose to an 
insurer a transaction or series of transactions to which the viatical settlement broker or 
viatical settlement provider is a party to originate, renew, continue, or finance a life 
insurance policy with the insurer for the purpose of engaging in the business of 
viatical settlements at any time prior to, or during the first five years after, issuance of 
the policy. 
Iowa Code § 508E.9 
 
Section 508E.10 - General rules1.a. A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical 
settlement contract shall first obtain all of the following:(1) If the viator is the insured, a written 
statement from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no 
constraint or undue influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract.(2) A document in which 
the insured consents to the release of the insured's medical records to a licensed viatical 
settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, and, if the policy was issued less than two years 
from the date of application for a viatical settlement contract, the insurance company that issued 
the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.b. Within twenty days after a viator 
executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within twenty 
days of entering any agreement, option, promise, or any other form of understanding, expressed 
or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the 
insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. 

The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by paragraph "c".c. The viatical 
provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under paragraph "a", subparagraph 
(2), a copy of the viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice required 
under paragraph "b", and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life 
policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The national association of insurance 
commissioners form for verification of coverage shall be used unless another form is developed 
and approved by the commissioner.d. The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of 
coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement 
broker within thirty days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on 
the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at 
this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The insurer shall 
accept a request for verification of coverage made on a national association of insurance 
commissioners form or any other form developed and approved by the commissioner. The 
insurer shall accept an original, facsimile, or electronic copy of such request and any 
accompanying authorization signed by the viator. A failure by the insurer to meet its obligations 
under this subsection shall be a violation of sections 508E.11 and 508E.17.e. Prior to or at the 
time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain 
a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents 
that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the viatical settlement contract, that the 
viator has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, 
acknowledges that the viator is entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and 
voluntarily, and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that 
the insured has a terminal or chronic illness or condition and that the terminal or chronic illness 
or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.f. If a viatical settlement 
broker performs any of these activities required of the viatical settlement provider, the viatical 
settlement provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.2. All medical 
information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of 
state law relating to confidentiality of medical information, including section 505.8.3. All viatical 
settlement contracts entered into in this state shall provide the viator with an absolute right to 
rescind the contract before the earlier of thirty days after the date upon which the viatical 
settlement contract is executed by all parties or fifteen days after the viatical settlement proceeds 
have been sent to the viator as provided in subsection 4. Rescission by the viator may be 
conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to the viatical settlement provider 
within the rescission period all viatical settlement proceeds, and any premiums, loans, and loan 
interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical settlement provider in connection with or as a 
consequence of the viatical settlement. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the 
viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the 
viatical settlement provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, and any premiums, 
loans, and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or purchaser, 
which shall be paid within sixty days of the death of the insured. In the event of any rescission, if 
the viatical settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a viatical 
settlement broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement broker 
shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the viatical settlement provider within 
five business days following receipt of written demand from the viatical settlement provider, 
which demand shall be accompanied by either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the 
election of the viator, or a notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of 

the insured within the applicable rescission period.4. The viatical settlement provider shall 
instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, 
assignment, or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three 
business days after the date the escrow agent receives the document, or from the date the viatical 
settlement provider receives the documents, if the viator erroneously provides the documents 
directly to the viatical settlement provider, the viatical settlement provider shall pay or transfer 
the viatical settlement proceeds into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally 
chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance 
corporation. Upon payment of the viatical settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the 
escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary 
forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider trust, or other designated 
representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the 
acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment, or designation of 
beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the viatical settlement 
proceeds to the viator.5. A failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement 
contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to section 508E.8, subsection 1, 
paragraph "g", renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack of 
consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds shall 
be deemed sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent 
either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via 
the United States postal service or other nationally recognized delivery service.6. A contact with 
the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the viatical 
settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred shall 
only be made by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker licensed pursuant 
to section 508E.3 or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three 
months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per 
month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less. The viatical settlement provider or 
viatical settlement broker shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the viatical 
settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to 
any contact with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. A 
viatical settlement provider and a viatical settlement broker shall be responsible for the actions of 
their authorized representatives. 
Iowa Code § 508E.10 
Section 508E.11 - Prohibited practices1. Except as provided in section 508E.12, it is a violation 
of this chapter for any person to enter into a viatical settlement contract at any time prior to the 
application or issuance of a policy which is the subject of a viatical settlement contract or within 
a five-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the insurance policy or 
certificate.2. An insurer shall not, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of 
coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a viatical settlement contract, require 
that the viator, insured, viatical settlement provider, or viatical settlement broker sign any form, 
disclosure, consent, or waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the commissioner 
for use in connection with viatical settlement contracts in this state.3. Upon receipt of a properly 
completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in 
writing within twenty days, with written acknowledgment confirming that the change has been 
effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be processed. The insurer 

shall not unreasonably delay effecting a change of ownership or beneficiary and shall not 
otherwise seek to interfere with any viatical settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state. 
Iowa Code § 508E.11

the viator certifies to the viatical settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions 
have been met within the five-year period:a. The policy was issued upon the viator's exercise of 
conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided the total of the time 
covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least sixty 
months. The time covered under a group policy shall be calculated without regard to any change 
in insurance carriers, provided the coverage has been continuous and under the same group 
sponsorship.b. The viator submits an affidavit to the viatical settlement provider that one or more 
of the following conditions exists:(1) The viator or insured is terminally or chronically ill.(2) The 
viator's spouse or child dies.(3) The viator divorces the viator's spouse.(4) The viator retires from

substantial part of the viator's assets.(7) Other circumstances as established as eligible 
exemptions by the commissioner by rule, including but not limited to substantial adverse 
financial circumstances or other factors substantially affecting the viator.2. Notwithstanding 
section 508E.11, a person may enter into a viatical settlement contract if at all times prior to the 
date that is two years after policy issuance, all of the following conditions are met with respect to 
the policy:a. Policy premiums have been funded exclusively with any of the 
following:(1) Unencumbered assets, including an interest in the life insurance policy being 
financed only to the extent of its net cash surrender value, provided by a person described in 
section 508E.2, subsection 15, paragraph "d", subparagraph (5).(2) Fully recourse liability 
incurred by the insured or a person described in section 508E.2, subsection 15, paragraph "d",

any such liability or to purchase, or stand ready to purchase, the policy, including through an

section 508E.10, subsection 1, shall be submitted to the insurer when the viatical settlement 
provider or viatical settlement broker submits a request to the insurer for verification of 
coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement 
provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical 
settlement provider.4. If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the 
owner's or insured's or insurer's affidavit described in this section when the provider submits a 
request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy or certificate to the viatical settlement 
provider, the copy shall be deemed to conclusively establish that the viatical settlement contract 
satisfies the requirement of this section and the insurer shall timely respond to the request. 
Iowa Code § 508E.12 
Section 508E.13 - Prohibited practices and conflicts of interest1. With respect to any viatical 
settlement contract or insurance policy, a viatical settlement broker shall not knowingly solicit an 

offer from, effectuate a viatical settlement with, or make a sale to any viatical settlement 
provider, viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity, or related provider trust that is 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such viatical settlement broker unless 
such relationship is disclosed to the viator.2. With respect to any viatical settlement contract or 
insurance policy, a viatical settlement provider shall not knowingly enter into a viatical 
settlement contract with a viator, if, in connection with such viatical settlement contract, 
anything of value will be paid to a viatical settlement broker that is controlling, controlled by, or 
under common control with such viatical settlement provider or the viatical settlement purchaser, 
financing entity, or related provider trust that is involved in such viatical settlement contract 
unless such relationship is disclosed to the viator.3. A viatical settlement provider shall not enter 
into a premium finance agreement with any person or agency, or any person affiliated with such 
person or agency, pursuant to which such person or agency shall receive any proceeds, fees, or 
other consideration, directly or indirectly, from the policy or owner of the policy or any other 
person with respect to the premium finance agreement or any viatical settlement contract or other 
transaction related to such policy that are in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, 
interest, and service charges related to policy premiums pursuant to the premium finance 
agreement or subsequent sale of such agreement. Any payments, charges, fees, normal insurance 
commissions, or other amounts in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest, 
and service charges related to policy premiums paid under the premium finance agreement shall 
be remitted to the original owner of the policy or to the original owner's estate if the original 
owner is not living at the time of the determination of the overpayment.4. A violation of 
subsection 1, 2, or 3 shall be deemed a fraudulent viatical settlement act.5. A person shall not 
issue, solicit, market, or otherwise promote the purchase of an insurance policy for the sole 
purpose of or with a primary emphasis on settling the policy.6. A person providing premium 
financing shall not receive any proceeds, fees, or other consideration from the policy or owner of 
the policy that are in addition to the amounts required to pay principal, interest, and any costs or 
expenses incurred by the lender or borrower in connection with the premium finance agreement, 
except for the event of a default, unless either the default on such loan or transfer of the policy 
occurs pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for the purpose of 
evading regulation under this chapter. Any payments, charges, fees, or other amounts received 
by a person providing premium financing in violation of this subsection shall be remitted to the 
original owner of the policy or to the original owner's estate if the original owner is not living at 
the time of the determination of overpayment.7. In the solicitation, application for, or issuance of 
a life insurance policy, a person shall not employ any device, scheme, or artifice to create an 
insurable interest in the life of a person except as provided in sections 511.39 and 511.40.8. No 
viatical settlement provider shall enter into a viatical settlement contract unless the viatical 
settlement promotional, advertising, and marketing materials, as may be prescribed by rules 
adopted by the commissioner, have been filed with the commissioner. In no event shall any 
marketing materials expressly reference that the insurance is free for any period of time. The 
inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause a viator to reasonably 
believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation of this 
chapter.9. No life insurance producer, insurance company, viatical settlement broker, or viatical 
settlement provider shall make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in 
connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is 
free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy. 
Iowa Code § 508E.13 

 
Section 508E.14 - Advertising for viatical settlements 
The purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous 
statements in the advertisement of viatical settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and 
adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of any viatical settlement 
contract. This purpose is intended to be accomplished by rules adopted by the commissioner for 
the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the 
advertising of viatical settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner 
that prevents unfair, deceptive, or misleading advertising, and is conducive to accurate 
presentation and description of viatical settlements through the advertising media and materials 
used by viatical settlement licensees. 
1. This section shall apply to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts or related products 
or services intended for dissemination in this state, including internet advertising viewed by 
persons located in this state. Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal 
regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal 
regulation wherever possible.2. Every viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times 
maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all 
advertisements of its contracts, products, and services. All advertisements, regardless of by 
whom written, created, designed, or presented, shall be the responsibility of the viatical 
settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement. A 
system of control shall include regular, routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and 
others authorized by the viatical settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of the 
requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by 
the viatical settlement licensee.3. An advertisement shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or 
by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract shall 
be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not have the capacity or 
tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to 
mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the 
advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or 
intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.4. The information required 
to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an 
ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or 
misleading.a. An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, 
statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect 
of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, 
premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement 
contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is 
made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement contract 
includes a free-look period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy a 
misleading statement.b. An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance 
company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the 
insurer.c. An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death 
benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper 
practice.d. The words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional cost", "at no extra cost", or 
words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An 

advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is 
included in the payment or use other appropriate language.e. Testimonials, appraisals, analyses, 
or endorsements used in advertisements must be genuine; represent the current opinion of the 
author; be applicable to the viatical settlement contract product or service advertised, if any; and 
be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving 
prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement. In using a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement, a licensee under this 
chapter makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to 
all of the provisions of this section.(1) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, 
or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, 
analysis, or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, 
officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required 
union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(2) An 
advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract benefit or product or 
service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association, or other 
organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the 
viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is 
owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives any payment or 
other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making an endorsement or 
testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.(3) When an endorsement refers to 
benefits received under a viatical settlement contract, all pertinent information shall be retained 
by the viatical settlement licensee for a period of five years after its use.5. An advertisement shall 
not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The 
source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified.6. An advertisement shall not 
disparage an insurer, viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, insurance producer, 
policy, services, or methods of marketing.7. The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be 
clearly identified in all advertisements about the viatical settlement licensee or its viatical 
settlement contract, products, or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is 
advertised, the viatical settlement contract shall be identified either by form number or some 
other appropriate description. If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the 
viatical settlement provider shall be shown on the application.8. An advertisement shall not use a 
trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, 
name of a particular division of the viatical settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or 
other device, or reference without disclosing the name of the viatical settlement licensee, if the 
advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity 
of the viatical settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the 
viatical settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a 
viatical settlement contract.9. An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, 
symbols, or physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other 
characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a 
government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to 
mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with 
a government program or agency.10. An advertisement may state that a viatical settlement 
licensee is licensed in the state where the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate 
that fact or suggest or imply that a competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. 
The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the viatical settlement licensee's internet site 

or contact the commissioner to find out if the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker is licensed.11. An advertisement shall 
not create the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the 
payment of its claims or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts 
are recommended or endorsed by any government entity.12. The name of the actual viatical 
settlement licensee shall be stated in each of its advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a 
trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate, or controlling entity of the viatical 
settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have 
the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual viatical 
settlement licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have 
any responsibility for the financial obligation of the viatical settlement licensee.13. An 
advertisement shall not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of 
the state or of the United States government endorses, approves, or favors any of the 
following:a. A viatical settlement licensee or its business practices or methods of 
operation.b. The merits, desirability, or advisability of any viatical settlement contract.c. Any 
viatical settlement contract.d. Any life insurance policy or life insurance company.14. If the 
advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will occur, the advertising must 
disclose the average time frame from completed application to the date of offer and from 
acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.15. If the advertising emphasizes the 
dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the average purchase price as a 
percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during the past six 
months. 
Iowa Code § 508E.14 
Section 508E.15 - Fraud prevention and control1.Fraudulent viatical settlement acts - 
interference, and participation of convicted felons prohibited.a. A person shall not commit a 
fraudulent viatical settlement act.b. A person shall not knowingly or intentionally interfere with 
the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or investigations of suspected or actual 
violations of this chapter.c. A person in the business of viatical settlements shall not knowingly 
or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust 
to participate in the business of viatical settlements.2.Fraud warning required.a. A viatical 
settlement contract and application for a viatical settlement, regardless of the form of 
transmission, shall contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement: 
Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or viatical 
settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison. 
b. The lack of a statement as required in paragraph "a" does not constitute a defense in any 
prosecution for a fraudulent viatical settlement act.3.Mandatory reporting of fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts.a. Any person engaged in the business of viatical settlements having knowledge 
or a reasonable suspicion that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has been 
committed shall provide to the commissioner such information as required by and in a manner 
prescribed by rules adopted by the commissioner.b. Any other person having knowledge or a 
reasonable belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has been committed 
may provide to the commissioner the information required by and in a manner prescribed by 
rules adopted by the commissioner.4.Immunity from liability.a. No civil liability shall be 
imposed on and no cause of action shall arise from a person who, acting reasonably and in good 

faith, furnishes information concerning suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts or suspected or completed fraudulent insurance acts, if the information is 
provided to or received from any of the following:(1) The commissioner or the commissioner's 
employees, agents, or representatives.(2) A federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory 
official or the official's employees, agents, or representatives.(3) A person involved in the 
prevention and detection of fraudulent viatical settlement acts or that person's agents, employees,

regulatory authority, inc.; the North American securities administrators association; their 
employees, agents, or representatives; or other regulatory body overseeing life insurance, viatical 
settlements, securities, or investment fraud.(5) A life insurer that issued the life insurance policy 
covering the life of the insured.b. Paragraph "a" does not apply to a statement made in bad faith 
or with actual malice. In an action brought against a person for filing a report or furnishing other 
information concerning a fraudulent viatical settlement act, the party bringing the action shall 
plead specifically any allegation that paragraph "a" does not apply because the person filing the 
report or furnishing the information did so in bad faith or with actual malice.c. A person 
furnishing information as identified in paragraph "a" shall be entitled to an award of attorney 
fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander, or 
any other relevant tort arising out of an activity in carrying out the provisions of this chapter and 
the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this 
paragraph, a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the 
time that it was initiated. However, such an award does not apply to any person furnishing 
information concerning the person's own fraudulent viatical settlement act.d. This section does 
not abrogate or modify a common law or statutory privilege or immunity enjoyed by a person 
described in paragraph "a".5.Confidentiality.a. A document or evidence provided pursuant to 
subsection 4 or obtained by the commissioner in an investigation of a suspected or actual 
fraudulent viatical settlement act shall be privileged and confidential, notwithstanding chapter 
22, shall not be a public record, and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or 
criminal action.b. Paragraph "a" does not prohibit the release by the commissioner of a 
document or evidence obtained in an investigation of a suspected or actual fraudulent viatical 
settlement act if any of the following applies:(1) In an administrative or judicial proceeding to 
enforce laws administered by the commissioner.(2) To a federal, state, or local law enforcement 
or regulatory agency, to an organization established for the purpose of detecting and preventing 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts, or to the national association of insurance 
commissioners.(3) At the discretion of the commissioner, to a person in the business of viatical 
settlements that is aggrieved by a fraudulent viatical settlement act.c. Release of a document or 
evidence under paragraph "b" does not abrogate or modify the privilege granted in 
paragraph "a".6.Other law enforcement or regulatory authority. This chapter shall not do any of 
the following:a. Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law enforcement or regulatory 
agencies to investigate, examine, and prosecute suspected violations of law.b. Prevent or prohibit 
a person from disclosing voluntarily information concerning viatical settlement fraud to a law 
enforcement or regulatory agency other than the commissioner.c. Limit the powers granted 
elsewhere by the laws of this state to the commissioner or an insurance fraud unit to investigate

wrongdoers.7.Viatical settlement antifraud initiatives.a. A viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker shall have in place antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, 
prosecute, and prevent fraudulent viatical settlement acts. At the discretion of the commissioner, 

the commissioner may order, or a licensee may request and the commissioner may grant, such 
modifications of the following required initiatives as necessary to ensure an effective antifraud

notwithstanding chapter 22, shall not be a public record, and shall not be subject to discovery or 
subpoena in a civil or criminal action.
