himself or itself, and where, at the time of inception, there is an arrangement or agreement, 
whether oral or written, to directly or indirectly transfer the ownership of the policy or the policy 
benefits to a third party. Trusts that are created to give the appearance of an insurable interest and

transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within twenty (20) days of entering any 
agreement, option, promise or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to settle 
the policy, the life settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that 
insurance policy that the policy has or will become a settled policy. The notice shall be 
accompanied by the documents required by subsection (3) of this section.(3) The life settlement

section;(b) A copy of the owner's application for the life settlement contract;(c) The notice 
required under subsection (2) of this section; and(d) A request for verification of coverage to the 
insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the life transaction. The NAIC's form for

director.(4) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an 
approved form by a life settlement provider or life settlement broker within thirty (30) calendar 
days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence 
and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at that time regarding the

insurer shall accept an original or facsimile or electronic copy of such request and any 
accompanying authorization signed by the owner. Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations 
under this subsection shall be a violation of section 41-1964, Idaho Code.(5) Prior to or at the 
time of execution of the life settlement contract, the life settlement provider shall obtain a 
witnessed document in which the owner consents to the life settlement contract, represents that 
the owner has a full and complete understanding of the life settlement contract, that he or she has 
a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that 
he or she is entering into the life settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with 

a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or 
chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life

the life settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this 
section.(7) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the 
applicable provisions of state and federal law relating to confidentiality of medical

this state as owner, shall provide the owner with an absolute right to rescind the contract within 
twenty (20) calendar days of the date upon which the life settlement contract is executed by all 
parties. Rescission by the owner is conditioned upon the owner both giving notice and repaying 
to the life settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any 
premiums, loans and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the life settlement provider in 
connection with or as a consequence of the life settlement. If the insured dies during the 
rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to 
repayment to the life settlement provider or other person of all life settlement proceeds, and any 
premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the life settlement provider or other

life settlement broker shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the life settlement 
provider within five (5) business days following receipt of written demand from the life 
settlement provider, which demand shall be accompanied by either the owner's notice of 
rescission if rescinded at the election of the owner, or notice of the death of the insured if 
rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the applicable rescission period.(9) The 
life settlement provider shall instruct the owner to send the executed documents required to 
effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary directly to an independent 
escrow agent. Within three (3) business days after the date the escrow agent receives the 
documents, or from the date the life settlement provider receives the documents, if the owner 
erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, the provider shall pay or transfer the 
proceeds of the life settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally-
chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance 
corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the 
escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary 
forms to the life settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of 
the life settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the 
properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the 
insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the owner.(10) Failure 
to tender consideration to the owner for the life settlement contract within the time set forth in 
the disclosure pursuant to section 41-1956(7), Idaho Code, renders the life settlement contract 
voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and 
accepted by the owner.(11) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health 
status of the insured by the life settlement provider or life settlement broker after the life 
settlement has occurred shall only be made by the life settlement provider or broker licensed in 
this state or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three (3) months for 
insureds with a life expectancy of more than one (1) year, and to no more than once per month 
for insureds with a life expectancy of one (1) year or less. The provider or broker shall explain 
the procedure for these contacts at the time the life settlement contract is entered into. The 

limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons 
other than determining the insured's health status. Life settlement providers and life settlement 
brokers shall be responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives.

the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation 
from the life settlement provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents 
received by the life settlement provider.(3) If the life settlement provider submits to the insurer a 
copy of the owner or insured's certification described in and the independent evidence required 
by subsection (1)(b) of this section when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect 
the transfer of the policy or certificate to the life settlement provider, the copy shall be deemed to 
conclusively establish that the life settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section 
and the insurer shall timely respond to the request.(4) No insurer may, as a condition of 
responding to a request for verification of coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant 
to a life settlement contract, require that the owner, insured, life settlement provider or life 
settlement broker sign any forms, disclosures, consent or waiver form that has not been filed 
with the director for use in connection with life settlement contracts in this state.(5) Upon receipt 
of a properly completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer 
shall respond in writing within thirty (30) days with written acknowledgment confirming that the 
change has been effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be 
processed. The insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary 

and shall not otherwise seek to interfere with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in 
this state.
