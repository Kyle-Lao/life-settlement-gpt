damages as the result of erroneous acts, failure to act, conviction of fraud, or conviction of unfair 
practices by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker. The commissioner 
shall accept, as evidence of financial responsibility, proof that financial instruments in

investigation is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the 
examination of the licensee.(3) In lieu of an examination under this article of any foreign or alien 
licensee licensed in this state, the commissioner may, at the commissioner's discretion, accept an

execution of the contract or purchase agreement, whichever is later; and all checks, drafts or 

other evidence and documentation related to the payment, transfer, deposit or release of funds

their power to do so. The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to 
submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner 
shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by

commissioner's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation or refusal of any license 
or authority shall be conducted pursuant to section eleven, article two of this chapter.(3) The

upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify 
or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order is punishable as contempt of 
court.(4) When making an examination under this article, the commissioner may retain attorneys, 
appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals 
and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is 
the subject of the examination.(5) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to limit the

examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating thereto, to 
the commissioner of any other state or country, or to law-enforcement officials of this or any

beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed to be viaticated.(2) Notwithstanding the 
requirements of this clause, the commissioner may retain, from time to time, on an individual

after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or thirty 
calendar days after the viatical settlement proceeds have been paid to the viator, as provided in

viator or the viator's estate of all viatical settlement proceeds to the viatical settlement provider 
within sixty days of the insured's death.(7) That funds will be sent to the viator within three 
business days after the viatical settlement provider has received the insurer or group

viatical settlement between the viator and the viatical settlement provider. If you are asked to 
provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be 
provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked 
to renew your permission to share information every two years."(11) That following execution of 
a viatical contract, the insured may be contacted for the purpose of determining the insured's 
health status and to confirm the insured's residential or business street address and telephone 
number or as otherwise provided in this article. This contact shall be limited to once every three 
months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and not more than once per 
month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less. All such contracts shall be made 
only by a viatical settlement provider licensed in the state in which the viator resided at the time 
of the viatical settlement, or by the authorized representative of a duly licensed viatical 
settlement provider.(b) A viatical settlement provider shall provide the viator with at least the 
following disclosures no later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all

and the extent to which the viator's interest in those benefits will be transferred as a result of the 

viatical settlement contract; and(6) State whether the funds will be escrowed with an independent 
third party during the transfer process and, if so, provide the name, business address and

W. Va. Code § 33-13C-8 
 
Section 33-13C-9 - Disclosure to insurer 
Before the initiation of a plan, transaction or series of transactions, a viatical settlement broker or 
viatical settlement provider shall fully disclose to an insurer a plan, transaction or series of 
transactions, to which the viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider is a part, to 
originate, renew, continue or finance a life insurance policy with the insurer for the purpose of 
engaging in the business of viatical settlements at anytime prior to, or during the first five years 
after, issuance of the policy. 
W. Va. Code § 33-13C-9 
Section 33-13C-10 - General rules(a)(1) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical 
settlement contract shall first obtain:(A) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a 
licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue 
influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract; and(B) A document in which the insured 
consents to the release of his or her medical records to a licensed viatical settlement provider, 
viatical settlement broker and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy 
covering the life of the insured.(2) Within twenty days after a viator executes documents 
necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within twenty days of entering any 
agreement, option, promise or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate 
the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that 
insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. The notice shall be 

accompanied by the documents required by subdivision (3) of this subsection.(3) The viatical 
provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under paragraph (B), subdivision (1) 
of this subsection, a copy of the viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice 
required under subdivision (2) of this subsection and a request for verification of coverage to the 
insurer that issued the life insurance policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The 
request for verification of coverage shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.(4) The 
insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage within thirty calendar days of the 
date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and 
documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the 
validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for 
verification made on an approved form or any facsimile or electronic copy of such request and 
any accompanying authorization signed by the viator. Failure by the insurer to meet its 
obligations under this subsection shall be a violation of subsection (c), section eleven of this 
article and section sixteen of this article.(5) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical 
settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which 
the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full 
understanding of the viatical settlement contract, that he or she has a full understanding of the 
benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that he or she is entering into the viatical 
settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or 
condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or 
chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.(6) If a 
viatical settlement broker performs any of these activities required of the viatical settlement 
provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.(b) All medical 
information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of 
state law relating to confidentiality of medical information.(c) All viatical settlement contracts 
entered into in this state shall provide the viator with an absolute right to rescind the contract 
before the earlier of sixty calendar days after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract 
is executed by all parties or thirty calendar days after the viatical settlement proceeds have been 
sent to the viator as provided in subsection (e) of this section. Rescission by the viator may be 
conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to the viatical settlement provider 
within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, loans and loan 
interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical settlement provider in connection with or as a result 
of the viatical settlement. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement 
contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the viatical settlement 
provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, any premiums, loans and loan interest 
that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or purchaser, which shall be paid within 
sixty calendar days of the death of the insured. In the event of any rescission, if the viatical 
settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a viatical settlement broker 
in connection with the rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement broker shall refund all such 
commissions and compensation to the viatical settlement provider within five business days 
following receipt of written demand from the viatical settlement provider, which demand shall be 
accompanied by either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the viator, or 
notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the 
applicable rescission period.(d) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send 
the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in 
beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three business days after the escrow 

agent receives the document or, if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the 
provider, after the viatical settlement provider receives the documents, the provider shall pay or 
transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a 
state or federally charted financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow 
account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership assignment or change in 
beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated 
representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the 
acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of 
beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to 
the viator.(e) Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement contract 
within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to subdivision (7), subsection (a), section 
eight of this article renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack of 
consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds shall 
be deemed sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent 
either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via 
United State Postal Service or other nationally recognized delivery service.(f) Contacts with the 
insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the viatical settlement 
provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred shall only be 
made by the viatical settlement provider or broker licensed in this state or its authorized 
representatives and shall be limited to once every three months for insureds with a life 
expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per month for insureds with a life 
expectancy of one year or less. The provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these 
contacts at the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in 
this subsection shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining 
the insured's health status. Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall be 
responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives. 
W. Va. Code § 33-13C-10 
Section 33-13C-11 - Prohibited practices(a) It is a violation of this article for any person to enter 
into a viatical settlement contract at any time prior to the application for or issuance of a policy

settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met within the five-
year period after issuance of the policy or certificate:(1) The policy was issued upon the viator's 
exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided the total of the 
time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least 
sixty (60) months. The time covered under a group policy shall be computed without regard to 
any change in insurance carriers, provided the coverage has been continuous and under the same 
group sponsorship;(2) The viator certifies and submits independent evidence to the viatical 
settlement provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met within that five-
year period:(A) The viator or insured is terminally or chronically ill;(B) The viator's spouse 
dies;(C) The viator divorces his or her spouse;(D) The viator retires from full-time 
employment;(E) The viator becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines 
that the disability prevents the viator from maintaining full-time employment; or(F) A court of 
competent jurisdiction enters a final order, judgment or decree on the application of a creditor of 

the viator and adjudicates the viator bankrupt or insolvent or approves a petition seeking 
reorganization of the viator or appoints a receiver, trustee or liquidator to all or a substantial part 
of the viator's assets; or(3) The viator enters into a viatical settlement contract more than two 
years after the date of issuance of a policy and, at all times during that two-year period, all of the 
following conditions are true with respect to the policy;(A) Policy premiums have been funded 
exclusively with unencumbered assets, including an interest in the life insurance policy being 
financed only to the extent of its net cash surrender value, provided by, or fully recourse liability 
incurred by, the insured on a person described in subparagraph (iv), paragraph (C), subdivision 
(13), section two of this article;(B) There is no agreement or understanding with any other person 
to guarantee any such liability or to purchase, or stand ready to purchase, the policy, including 
through an assumption or forgiveness of the loan; and(C) Neither the insured nor the policy has 
been evaluated for settlement.(b) Copies of the independent evidence described in subdivision 
(2), subsection (a) of this section and documents required by subsection (a), section ten of this 
article shall be submitted to the insurer when the viatical settlement provider or other party 
entering into a viatical settlement contract with a viator submits a request to the insurer for 
verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the 
viatical settlement provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received 
by the viatical settlement provider.(c) If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a 
copy of the owner or insured's certification described in and the independent evidence required 
by subdivision (2), subsection (a) of this section when the provider submits a request to the 
insurer to effect the transfer of the policy or certificate to the viatical settlement provider, the 
copy shall be deemed to conclusively establish that the viatical settlement contract satisfies the 
requirements of this section and the insurer shall timely respond to the request.(d) No insurer 
may, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of coverage or effecting the 
transfer of a policy pursuant to a viatical settlement contract, require that the viator, insured, 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker sign any forms, disclosures, consent or 
waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the commissioner for use in connection 
with viatical settlement contracts in this state.(e) Upon receipt of a properly completed request 
for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in writing within 
thirty calendar days with written acknowledgment confirming that the change has been effected 
or specifying the reasons why the request change cannot be processed. The insurer shall not 
unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary and shall not otherwise seek to 
interfere with any viatical settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state. 
W. Va. Code § 33-13C-11 
 
Section 33-13C-12 - Prohibited practices and conflicts of interest(a) With respect to any viatical 
settlement contract or insurance policy, no viatical settlement broker knowingly shall solicit an 
offer from, effectuate a viatical settlement with or make a sale to any viatical settlement 
provider, viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity or related provider trust that is 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with such viatical settlement broker.(b) With 
respect to any viatical settlement contract or insurance policy, no viatical settlement provider 
knowingly may enter into a viatical settlement contract with a viator, if, in connection with such 
viatical settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a viatical settlement broker that is 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with such viatical settlement provider or the 
viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in such 

viatical settlement contract.(c) A violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be deemed 
a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(d) No viatical settlement provider shall enter into a viatical 
settlement contract unless the viatical settlement promotional, advertising and marketing 
materials, as may be prescribed by rule, have been filed with the commissioner. In no event shall 
any marketing materials expressly reference that the insurance is "free" for any period of time. 
The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause a viator to reasonably 
believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation of this 
article.(e) No life insurance producer, insurance company, viatical settlement broker or viatical 
settlement provider shall make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in 
connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is 
free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy. 
W. Va. Code § 33-13C-12 
Section 33-13C-13 - Advertising for viatical settlements(a) The purpose of this section is to 
provide prospective viators with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of 
viatical settlements and to assure the clear, truthful and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, 
limitations and exclusions of any viatical settlement contract. This purpose is intended to be 
accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible 
conduct in the advertising of viatical settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented 
in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive or misleading advertising and is conducive to 
accurate presentation and description of viatical settlements through the advertising media and 
material used by viatical settlement licensees.(b) This section shall apply to any advertising of 
viatical settlement contracts or related products or services intended for dissemination in this 
state, including internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. Where disclosure 
requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as 
to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.(c) Every viatical 
settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, 
form and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products and services. 
All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed or presented, shall be the 
responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or 
presented the advertisement. A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at 
least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the viatical settlement licensee who 
disseminates advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of 
any advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement license.(d) Advertisements shall be 
truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement 
of a viatical settlement contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. 
It shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has 
the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the 
overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of 
average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(e) The 
information required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, 
or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to 
be confusing or misleading.(1) An advertisement shall not omit material information or use 
words, phrases, statements, references or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, 
tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or extent of any benefit, 
loss covered, premium payable or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical 

settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or 
an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement 
contract includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not 
remedy misleading statements.(2) An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life 
insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the 
insurer.(3) An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death 
benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable or in any manner an incorrect or improper 
practice.(4) The words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional cost", "at no extra cost" 
or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An 
advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is 
included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(5) Testimonials, appraisals or 
analysis used in advertisements must be genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be 
applicable to the viatical settlement contract product or service advertised, if any; and be 
accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective 
viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisals or analysis, a licensee under this 
article makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all 
the provisions of this section.(A) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis or an 
endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, 
analysis or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, 
officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required 
union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(B) An 
advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract benefit or service has 
been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization 
unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the viatical 
settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, 
controlled or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other

years after its use.(f) An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it 
accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The course of all statistics used in an advertisement

policies, services or methods of marketing.(h) The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall 
be clearly identified in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract, 
products or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical

designation, name of the parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular 
division of the viatical settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or other device or 
reference without disclosing the name of the viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement 
would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical 
settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the viatical settlement 
licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement 
contract.(j) An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols or physical 

materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color or other characteristics are so similar to 
a combination of words, symbols or physical materials used by a government program or agency 
or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into 
believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or 
agency.(k) An advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state 
where the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply 
that competing viatical settlement licensees may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask 
the audience to consult the licensee's website or contact the department of insurance to find out if 
the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker is licensed.(l) An advertisement shall not create the impression that the viatical 
settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, 
desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts are recommended or endorsed by 
any government entity.(m) The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its 
advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of 
any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or other device in 
a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of 
the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have 
any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(n) An advertisement shall not, 
directly or indirectly, create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the 
United States government endorses, approves or favors:(1) Any viatical settlement licensee or its 
business practices or methods of operation;(2) The merits, desirability or advisability of any 
viatical settlement contract;(3) Any viatical settlement contract; or(4) Any life insurance policy 
or life insurance company.(o) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication 
will occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed application to 
the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(p) If the 
advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the 
average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the 
licensee during the past six months.
