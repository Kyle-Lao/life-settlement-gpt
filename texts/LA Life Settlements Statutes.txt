employees, and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the 
examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of a licensee by its officers, 
directors, employees, or agents to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable 
written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal 
of, any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in the viatical settlement business or 
other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, 
revocation, or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 12 of

punishable as contempt of court.(4) When making an examination under this Part, the 

commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified 
public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of 
which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the examination.(5) Nothing contained 
in this Part shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an 
examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of 
this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima 
facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(6) Nothing contained in this Part shall be 
construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any

recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.(2) No later than 
sixty days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the 
commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified 
report, the commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a 
notice that shall afford the licensee examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty

investigation by the commissioner of the financial condition or market conduct of a licensee shall 
be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be made 
public by the commissioner, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), or 
any other person, except to the insurance departments of other states or in any adjudicatory 
hearing or court proceeding invoked by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of 
this Chapter.(3) Neither the commissioner nor any person that received the documents, material, 
or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner, including the NAIC 
and its affiliates and subsidiaries, shall be permitted to testify in any private civil action 
concerning any confidential documents, materials, or information subject to Paragraph (1) of this 
Subsection.(4) In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's duties, the

jurisdiction that is substantially similar to the privilege established under this Subsection shall be 
available and enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this state.(7) Nothing contained

content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter 
relating thereto to the commissioner of any other state or country, or to law enforcement officials 
of this or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time, or to the NAIC, so 
long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to 
hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this Part.F. Conflict of interest.(1) An 
examiner may not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, 
has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary interest in 
any person subject to examination under this Part. This Section shall not be construed to 
automatically preclude an examiner from being:(a) A viator;(b) An insured in a viaticated 
insurance policy; or(c) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed to be 
viaticated.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this clause, the commissioner may retain from 
time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants, or other 
similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions, even though these persons 
may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination 
under this Part.G. Cost of examinations. 
Whenever the commissioner of insurance examines a licensee under this Part, all expenses 
incurred by the commissioner of insurance in conducting such examination, including the 
expenses and fees of examiners, auditors, accountants, actuaries, attorneys, or clerical or other 
assistants who are employed by the commissioner to make the examinations, shall be paid by the 
licensee examined. All funds so generated and collected shall be used only to defray the 
expenses of reviews and examinations and for no other purpose. 
H. Immunity from liability.(1) No cause of action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed 
against the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized representatives, or any examiner 
appointed by the commissioner for any statements made or conduct performed in good faith 
while carrying out the provisions of this Part.(2) No cause of action shall arise, nor shall any 
liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or 
data to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative or examiner pursuant 
to an examination made under this Part, if the act of communication or delivery was performed 
in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive. This Paragraph does not 
abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore 
enjoyed by any person identified in Paragraph (1).(3) A person identified in Paragraph (1) or (2) 
of this Subsection shall be entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs if he or she is the 
prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising out 

of activities in carrying out the provisions of this Part and the party bringing the action was not 
substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this Section, a proceeding is "substantially 
justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.I. Investigative 
authority of the commissioner. The commissioner may investigate suspected fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts and persons engaged in the business of viatical settlements. 
La. R.S. § 22:1796 
Section 22:1797 - DisclosureA. With each application for a viatical settlement, a viatical 
settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator with at least the 
following disclosures no later than the time the application for the viatical settlement contract is 
signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be provided in a separate document that is signed by 
the viator and the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker and shall provide the 
following information:(1) There are possible alternatives to viatical settlement contracts 
including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the viator's life insurance 
policy.(2) Some or all of the proceeds of the viatical settlement may be taxable under federal 
income tax and state franchise and income taxes, and assistance should be sought from a 
professional tax advisor.(3) Proceeds of the viatical settlement could be subject to the claims of 
creditors.(4) Receipt of the proceeds of a viatical settlement may adversely affect the viator's 
eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits or entitlement, and advice should be 
obtained from the appropriate government agencies.(5) The viator has the right to rescind a 
viatical settlement contract for fifteen calendar days after the receipt of the viatical settlement 
proceeds by the viator, as provided in this Part. If the insured dies during the rescission period, 
the settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all 
viatical settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the viatical settlement 
provider or purchaser.(6) Funds will be sent to the viator within three business days after the 
viatical settlement provider has received the insurer or group administrator's acknowledgment 
that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary 
has been designated.(7) Entering into a viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or 
benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the 
policy or certificate, to be forfeited by the viator. Assistance should be sought from a financial 
advisor.(8) Disclosure to a viator shall include distribution of a brochure describing the process 
of viatical settlements. The NAIC's form for the brochure shall be used unless one is developed 
by the commissioner.(9) The disclosure document shall contain the following language: "All 
medical, financial, or personal information solicited or obtained by a viatical settlement provider 
or viatical settlement broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or the identity of 
family members, a spouse, or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the 
viatical settlement between the viator and the viatical settlement provider. If you are asked to 
provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be 
provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked 
to renew your permission to share information every two years."(10) The insured may be 
contacted by either the viatical settlement provider or broker or its authorized representative for 
the purpose of determining the insured's health status. This contact is limited to once every three 
months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and no more than once per 
month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less.B. A viatical settlement provider 
shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the viatical 
settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in 

the viatical settlement contract or in a separate document signed by the viator and the viatical 
settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, and provide the following information:(1) State 
the affiliation, if any, between the viatical settlement provider and the issuer of the insurance 
policy to be viaticated.(2) The document shall include the name, address, and telephone number 
of the viatical settlement provider.(3) If an insurance policy to be viaticated has been issued as a 
joint policy or involves family riders or any coverage of a life other than the insured under the 
policy to be viaticated, the viator shall be informed of the possible loss of coverage on the other 
lives under the policy and shall be advised to consult with his or her insurance producer or the 
insurer issuing the policy for advice on the proposed viatical settlement.(4) State the dollar 
amount of the current death benefit payable to the viatical settlement provider under the policy or 
certificate. If known, the viatical settlement provider shall also disclose the availability of any 
additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar amount of any accidental death and 
dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate, and the viatical settlement provider's 
interest in those benefits.(5) State the name, business address, and telephone number of the 
independent third-party escrow agent and the fact that the viator or owner may inspect or receive 
copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents.C. If the provider transfers 
ownership or changes the beneficiary of the insurance policy, the provider shall communicate the 
change in ownership or beneficiary to the insured within twenty days after the change.D. A 
viatical settlement provider or its viatical settlement investment agent shall provide the viatical 
settlement purchaser with at least the following disclosures prior to the date the viatical 
settlement purchase agreement is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously 
displayed in any viatical purchase contract or in a separate document signed by the viatical 
settlement purchaser and viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement investment agent, and 
shall make the following disclosure to the viatical settlement purchaser:(1) The purchaser will 
receive no returns (i.e., dividends and interest) until the insured dies.(2) The actual annual rate of 
return on a viatical settlement contract is dependent upon an accurate projection of the insured's 
life expectancy and the actual date of the insured's death. An annual "guaranteed" rate of return 
is not determinable.(3) The viaticated life insurance contract should not be considered a liquid 
purchase since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity and the funds probably 
are not available until the death of the insured. There is no established secondary market for 
resale of these products by the purchaser.(4) The purchaser may lose all benefits or may receive 
substantially reduced benefits if the insurer goes out of business during the term of the viatical 
investment.(5) The purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance premium or other costs 
related to the policy, if required by the terms of the viatical purchase agreement. These payments 
may reduce the purchaser's return. If a party other than the purchaser is responsible for the 
payment, the name and address of that party also shall be disclosed.(6) The purchaser is 
responsible for payment of the insurance premiums or other costs related to the policy if the 
insured returns to health and to disclose the amount of such premiums, if applicable.(7) State the 
name and address of any person providing escrow services and the relationship to the 
broker.(8) The amount of any trust fees or other expenses to be charged to the viatical settlement 
purchaser shall be disclosed.(9) State whether the purchaser is entitled to a refund of all or part of 
his or her investment under the settlement contract if the policy is later determined to be null and 
void.(10) Disclose that group policies may contain limitations or caps in the conversion rights, 
additional premiums may have to be paid if the policy is converted, name the party responsible 
for the payment of the additional premiums, and, if a group policy is terminated and replaced by 
another group policy, state that there may be no right to convert the original 

coverage.(11) Disclose the risks associated with policy contestability including but not limited to 
the risk that the purchaser will have no claim or only a partial claim to death benefits should the 
insurer rescind the policy within the contestability period.(12) Disclose whether the purchaser 
will be the owner of the policy in addition to being the beneficiary, and if the purchaser is the 
beneficiary only and not also the owner, the special risks associated with that status, including 
but not limited to the risk that the beneficiary may be changed or the premium may not be 
paid.(13) Describe the experience and qualifications of the person who determines the life 
expectancy of the insured, i.e., in-house staff, independent physicians, and specialty firms that 
weigh medical and actuarial data, the information this projection is based on, and the relationship 
of the projection maker to the viatical settlement provider, if any.(14) Disclosure to an investor 
shall include distribution of a brochure describing the process of investment in viatical 
settlements. The NAIC's form for the brochure shall be used unless one is developed by the 
commissioner.E. A viatical settlement provider or its viatical settlement investment agent shall 
provide the viatical settlement purchaser with at least the following disclosures no later than at 
the time of the assignment, transfer, or sale of all or a portion of an insurance policy. The 
disclosures shall be contained in a document signed by the viatical settlement purchaser and 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement investment agent, and shall make the following 
disclosures to the viatical settlement purchaser:(1) Disclose all the life expectancy certifications 
obtained by the provider in the process of determining the price paid to the viator.(2) State 
whether premium payments or other costs related to the policy have been escrowed. If escrowed, 
state the date upon which the escrowed funds will be depleted and whether the purchaser will be 
responsible for payment of premiums thereafter and, if so, the amount of the premiums.(3) State 
whether premium payments or other costs related to the policy have been waived. If waived, 
disclose whether the investor will be responsible for payment of the premiums if the insurer that 
wrote the policy terminates the waiver after purchase and the amount of those 
premiums.(4) Disclose the type of policy offered or sold, any additional benefits contained in the 
policy, and the current status of the policy.(5) If the policy is term insurance, disclose the special 
risks associated with term insurance, including but not limited to the purchaser's responsibility 
for additional premiums if the viator continues the term policy at the end of the current 
term.(6) State whether the policy is contestable.(7) State whether the insurer that wrote the policy 
has any additional rights that could negatively affect or extinguish the purchaser's rights under 
the viatical settlement contract, what these rights are, and under what conditions these rights are 
activated.(8) State the name and address of the person responsible for monitoring the insured's 
condition. Describe how often the monitoring of the insured's condition is done, how the date of 
death is determined, and how and when this information will be transmitted to the 
purchaser.F. The viatical settlement purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser at any time 
within three days after the disclosures mandated by Subsections D and E of this Section are 
received by the purchaser. 
La. R.S. § 22:1797 
Section 22:1798 - General rulesA.(1) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical 
settlement contract shall first obtain:(a) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a 
licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue 
influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract;(b) If applicable, a witnessed document in 
which the viator represents that the insured is terminally ill or chronically ill and that the illness 
was diagnosed after the policy was issued; and(c) A document in which the insured consents to 

the release of his or her medical records to a viatical settlement provider and the viatical 
settlement broker.(2) Within twenty days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer 
any rights under an insurance policy or within twenty days of entering any agreement, option, 
promise, or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the 
viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance 
policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy.(3) The viatical provider or viatical 
settlement broker shall deliver a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the 
life policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The NAIC's form for verification shall be 
used unless standards for verification are developed by the commissioner.(4) The insurer shall 
respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical 
settlement provider or viatical settlement broker within thirty calendar days of the date the 
request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents 
provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the 
insurance contract.(5) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the 
viatical settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the 
viatical settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of 
the viatical settlement contract, that he or she has a full and complete understanding of the 
benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that he or she is entering into the viatical 
settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or 
condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or 
chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.(6) If a 
viatical settlement broker performs any of these activities required of the viatical settlement 
provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this Section.B. All medical 
information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of 
state law relating to confidentiality of medical information.C. All viatical settlement contracts 
entered into in this state shall provide the viator with an unconditional right to rescind the 
contract for at least fifteen calendar days from the receipt of the viatical settlement proceeds. If 
the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to 
have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser of all 
viatical settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest that have been paid by 
the viatical settlement provider or purchaser.D. The purchaser shall have the right to rescind a 
viatical settlement purchase agreement within three days after the disclosures mandated by R.S. 
22:1797(D) and (E) are received by the purchaser.E. The viatical settlement provider shall 
instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, 
assignment, or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three 
business days after the date the escrow agent receives the document (or from the date the viatical 
settlement provider receives the documents, if the viator erroneously provides the documents 
directly to the provider), the provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement 
into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally chartered financial institution 
whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Upon payment 
of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original 
change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement 
provider or related provider trust. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the 
properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment, or designation of beneficiary from the 
insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.F. Failure to 
tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time disclosed 

pursuant to R.S. 22:1797(A)(6) renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for 
lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the 
viator.G. Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured 
by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has 
occurred shall only be made by the viatical settlement provider or broker licensed in this state or 
its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three months for insureds with a 
life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per month for insureds with a 
life expectancy of one year or less. The provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these 
contacts at the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in 
this Subsection shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining 
the insured's health status. Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall be 
responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives. 
La. R.S. § 22:1798 
 
Section 22:1799 - Prohibited practicesA. It is a violation of this Part for any person to enter into 
a viatical settlement contract at any time prior to the application for or issuance of a life 
insurance policy or certificate which is the subject of a viatical settlement contract or for a two-
year period commencing with the date of issuance of the insurance policy or certificate unless 
the viator certifies and submits independent evidence to the viatical settlement provider that one 
or more of the following conditions have been met within the two-year period:(1) The viator or 
insured is terminally or chronically ill; or(2) A final order, judgment, or decree is entered by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the viator, adjudicating the 
viator bankrupt or insolvent or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the viator or 
appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the viator's 
assets.B.(1) Documents required by R.S. 22:1798(A)shall be submitted to the insurer when the 
viatical settlement provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The 
copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement provider that 
the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical settlement 
provider.(2) If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner or 
insured's certification described in Subsection A of this Section when the provider submits a 
request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy or certificate to the viatical settlement 
provider, the copy shall be deemed to conclusively establish that the viatical settlement contract 
satisfies the requirements of this Section and the insurer shall timely respond to the request. 
La. R.S. § 22:1799 
Section 22:1800 - Advertising for viatical settlements and viatical settlements purchase 
agreementsA. The purpose of this Section is to provide prospective viators and viatical 
settlement purchasers with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of viatical 
settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, 
limitations, and exclusions of any viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement bought or sold. This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of 
guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical 
settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, 
deceptive, or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of 
viatical settlements through the advertising media and material used by viatical settlement 

licensees.B. This Section shall apply to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts, viatical 
purchase agreements, or related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, 
including internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. Where disclosure 
requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this Section shall be interpreted so as 
to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.C. Every viatical 
settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, 
form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products, and services. 
All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed, or presented, shall be the 
responsibility of the viatical settlement licensee, as well as the individual who created or 
presented the advertisement. A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at 
least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the viatical settlement licensee who 
disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of 
any advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement licensee.D. Advertisements shall be 
truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement 
of a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, product, or service 
shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not have the capacity or 
tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to 
mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the 
advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or 
intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.E. Certain viatical settlement 
advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are prohibited. False and 
misleading viatical settlement advertisements include but are not limited to the following 
representations:(1) "Guaranteed", "fully secured", "100 percent secured", "fully insured", 
"secure", "safe", "backed by rated insurance companies", "backed by federal law", "backed by 
state law", "state guaranty funds", or similar representations;(2) "No risk", "minimal risk", "low 
risk", "no speculation", "no fluctuation", or similar representations;(3) "Qualified or approved for 
individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, 401(k) plans, simplified employee pensions 
(SEP), 403(b), Keogh plans, TSA, other retirement account rollovers", "tax deferred", or similar 
representations;(4) Utilization of the word "guaranteed" to describe the fixed return, annual 
return, principal, earnings, profits, investment, or similar representations;(5) "No sales charges or 
fees" or similar representations;(6) "High yield", "superior return", "excellent return", "high 
return", "quick profit", or similar representations;(7) Purported favorable representations or 
testimonials about the benefits of viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase 
agreements as an investment, taken out of context from newspapers, trade papers, journals, radio 
and television programs, and all other forms of print and electronic media.F.(1) The information 
required to be disclosed under this Section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or 
presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be 
confusing or misleading.(2) An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, 
phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, 
or effect of misleading or deceiving viators, purchasers, or prospective purchasers as to the 
nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax 
consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer 
is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement contract 
or viatical settlement purchase agreement includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds 
legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.(3) An advertisement shall not use 

the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement 
has been approved by the insurer.(4) An advertisement shall not represent that premium 
payments will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that is the subject of a 
viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement in order to maintain that 
policy, unless that is the fact.(5) An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged 
on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an 
incorrect or improper practice.(6) The words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional 
cost", "at no extra cost", or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit 
or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may 
state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate 
language.(7)(a) Testimonials, appraisals, or analysis used in advertisements must be genuine; 
represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the viatical settlement contract or 
viatical settlement purchase agreement, product, or service advertised, if any; and be accurately 
reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators or 
purchasers as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement. In 
using testimonials, appraisals, or analysis, the viatical settlement licensee makes as its own all 
the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this 
Section.(b) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or an endorsement has a 
financial interest in the viatical settlement provider or related entity as a stockholder, director, 
officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required 
union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(c) An 
advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement 
purchase agreement, benefit, or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, 
society, association, or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship 
between an organization and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the 
endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, 
or receives any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making 
an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.(d) When an 
endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement 
purchase agreement, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its 
use.G. An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects 
recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be 
identified.H. An advertisement shall not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, viatical 
settlement brokers, viatical settlement investment agents, insurance producers, policies, services, 
or methods of marketing.I. The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be clearly identified 
in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement 
purchase agreements, products, or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract or 
viatical settlement purchase agreement is advertised, the viatical settlement contract or viatical 
settlement purchase agreement shall be identified either by form number or some other 
appropriate description. If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical 
settlement provider shall be shown on the application.J. An advertisement shall not use a trade 
name, group designation, name of the parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a 
particular division of the viatical settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other 
device or reference without disclosing the name of the viatical settlement licensee, if the 
advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity 
of the viatical settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the 

viatical settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a 
viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement.K. An advertisement shall 
not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by their content, 
phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, 
symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to 
be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators or purchasers into believing that 
the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.L. An 
advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the 
advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that 
competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the 
audience to consult the licensee's web site or contact the Department of Insurance to find out if 
the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement 
broker, or viatical settlement investment agent is licensed.M. An advertisement shall not create 
the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment 
of its claims, or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts or 
viatical settlement purchase agreement forms are recommended or endorsed by any government 
entity.N. The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its advertisements. An 
advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or 
controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that 
would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual 
licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any 
responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.O. An advertisement shall not directly 
or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the United States 
government endorses, approves, or favors:(1) Any viatical settlement licensee or its business 
practices or methods of operation;(2) The merits, desirability, or advisability of any viatical 
settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement;(3) Any viatical settlement contract 
or viatical settlement purchase agreement; or(4) Any life insurance policy or life insurance 
company.P. If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will occur, the 
advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed application to the date of offer 
and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.Q. If the advertising 
emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the average 
purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during 
the past six months.

similar statement:

settlement contract or a viatical settlement purchase agreement is guilty of a crime and may be 
subject to fines and confinement in prison." 
(2) The lack of a statement as required in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection does not constitute a 
defense in any prosecution for a fraudulent viatical settlement act.C. Mandatory reporting of 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts.(1) Any person engaged in the business of viatical settlements 
having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be,

such suspected fraudulent viatical settlement act to the insurer that issued the policy, the 
information required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the commissioner.(2) Any other person

imposed on and no cause of action shall arise from a person's furnishing information concerning
