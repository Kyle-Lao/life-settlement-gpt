affairs of the licensee being examined. The officers, directors, employees and agents of the 
licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in 
their power to do so. The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to 
submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the Commissioner is 
grounds for suspension, revocation or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held 
by the licensee to engage in the viatical settlement business or other business subject to the

Court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary 
evidence. Failure to obey the court order is punishable as contempt of court.(4) When making an 
examination under this Act, the Commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent 
actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as

examination.(5) Nothing contained in this Act limits the Commissioner's authority to terminate 
or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the 
insurance laws of this State. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination 
are prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(6) Nothing contained in this Act limits 
the Commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary 
examination report, any examiner or licensee workpapers or other documents, or any other 
information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of

Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's sole discretion, deem appropriate.(d) Examination 
Reports.(1) Examination reports may only be comprised of facts appearing upon the books, 
records or other documents of the licensee, its agents or other persons examined, or as 
ascertained from the testimony of its officers or agents or other persons examined concerning its 
affairs, and such conclusions and recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted 
from the facts.(2) No later than 60 days following completion of the examination, the examiner 
in charge shall file with the Commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath. 
Upon receipt of the verified report, the Commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee

provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked 
to renew your permission to share information every two years."(11) Following execution of a 
viatical settlement contract, the insured may be contacted for the purpose of determining the 
insured's health status and to confirm the insured's residential or business street address and 
telephone number, or as otherwise provided in this Act. This contact must be limited to once 
every 3 months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than 1 year, and no more than once 
per month if the insured has a life expectancy of 1 year or less. All such contracts may only be

of a life other than the insured under the policy to be viaticated, the viator must be informed of 
the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and must be advised to consult 
with his or her insurance producer or the company issuing the policy for advice on the proposed 
viatical settlement.(5) State the dollar amount of the current death benefit payable to the viatical 
settlement provider under the policy or certificate. If known, the viatical settlement provider 
shall also disclose the availability of any additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar 
amount of any accidental death and dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate, and

18 Del. C. § 7508 
Section 7509 - Disclosure to insurer 
Prior to the initiation of a plan, transaction, or series of transactions, a viatical settlement broker 
or viatical settlement provider shall fully disclose to an insurer a plan, transaction, or series of 
transactions, to which the viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider is a party, to 
originate, renew, continue, or finance a life insurance policy with the insurer for the purpose of 
engaging in the business of viatical settlements at any time prior to, or during the first 5 years 
after, issuance of the policy. 
18 Del. C. § 7509 
Section 7510 - General rules(a) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical settlement 
contract shall first obtain the following:(1) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a 
licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue 
influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract.(2) 
A document in which the insured consents to the release of the insured's medical records to a 
licensed viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, and the insurance company that 
issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured. 
(3) Within 20 days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an 
insurance policy or within 20 days of entering any agreement, option, promise, or any other form 
of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider 
shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will 
become a viaticated policy. The notice must be accompanied by the documents required by this 
subsection.(4) The viatical settlement provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release 
required under paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection, a copy of the viator's application for the 

viatical settlement contract, the notice required under § 7509 of this Act, and a request for 
verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the subject of the viatical 
transaction. The NAIC's form for verification of coverage must be used unless another form is 
developed and approved by the Commissioner.(5) The insurer shall respond to a request for 
verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or 
viatical settlement broker within 30 calendar days of the date the request is received and indicate 
whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue 
an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. 
The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on an NAIC form or any 
other form approved by the Commissioner. The insurer shall accept an original, facsimile, or 
electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the viator. Failure 
by the insurer to meet its obligations under this subsection is a violation of §§ 7511(c) and 7516 
of this Act.(6) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical 
settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical 
settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the 
viatical settlement contract, that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the benefits 
of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that the viator is entering into the viatical settlement 
contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, 
acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness or condition that was diagnosed 
after the life insurance policy was issued.(7) If a viatical settlement broker performs any of these 
activities required of the viatical settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the 
requirements of this subsection.(b) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee 
is subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to confidentiality of medical 
information.(c) All viatical settlement contracts entered into in this State must provide the viator 
with an absolute right to rescind the contract before the earlier of 60 calendar days after the date 
upon which the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or 30 calendar days after the 
viatical settlement proceeds have been sent to the viator as provided in § 7510(f) of this Act. 
Rescission by the viator may be conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to 
the viatical settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and 
any premiums, loans and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical settlement provider in 
connection with or as a consequence of the viatical settlement. If the insured dies during the 
rescission period, the viatical settlement contract is deemed to have been rescinded, subject to 
repayment to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, and 
any premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or 
purchaser, which must be paid within 60 calendar days of the death of the insured. In the event of 
any rescission, if the viatical settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to 
a viatical settlement broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement 
broker shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the viatical settlement provider 
within 5 business days following receipt of written demand from the viatical settlement provider, 
which demand must be accompanied by either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the 
election of the viator, or notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of 
the insured within the applicable rescission period.(d) The viatical settlement provider shall 
instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, 
assignment or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within 3 business 
days after the date the escrow agent receives the document (or from the date the viatical 
settlement provider receives the documents, if the viator erroneously provides the documents 

directly to the provider), the provider must pay or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement 
into an escrow or trust account maintained in a state or federally-chartered financial institution 
whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Upon payment 
of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original 
change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement 
provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of the viatical settlement 
provider. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed 
transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the 
escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.(e) Failure to tender consideration to 
the viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant 
to § 7508(a)(7) of this title renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack 
of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds are 
deemed sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent 
either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via 
United States Postal Service or other nationally recognized delivery service.(f)Contacts with the 
insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the viatical settlement 
provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred may only be made 
by the viatical settlement provideror broker licensed in this State or its authorized representative 
and are limited to once every 3 months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than 1 year, 
and to no more than 1 per month for insureds with a life expectancy of 1 year or less. The 
provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the viatical 
settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection do not apply to any 
contacts with an insured under a viaticated policy for reasons other than determining the 
insured's health status. Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers are 
responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives.(g) A related provider trust must 
have a written agreement with the licensed viatical settlement provider under which the licensed 
viatical settlement provider is responsible for ensuring compliance with all statutory and 
regulatory requirements and under which the trust agrees to make all records and files related to 
viatical settlement transactions available to the Commissioner as if those records and files were 
maintained directly by the licensed viatical settlement provider. 
18 Del. C. § 7510 
 
Section 7511 - Prohibited practices(a) It is a violation of this Act for any person to enter into a 
viatical settlement contract at any time prior to the application or issuance of a policy which is 
the subject of viatical settlement contract or within a 5 year period commencing with the date of 
issuance of the insurance policy or certificate unless the viator certifies to the viatical settlement 
provider that 1 or more of the following conditions have been met within the 5 year 
period:(1) The policy was issued upon the viator's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a 
group or individual policy, if the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the 
time covered under the prior policy is at least 60 months. The time covered under a group policy 
must be calculated without regard to any change in insurance carriers, if the coverage has been 
continuous and under the same group sponsorship.(2) The viator submits independent evidence 
to the viatical settlement provider that 1 or more of the following conditions have been met 
within the 5year period:a. The viator or insured is terminally or chronically ill.b. The viator's 
spouse dies.c. The viator divorces his or her spouse.d. The viator retires from full-time 

employment.e. The viator becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines 
that the disability prevents the viator from maintaining full-time employment.f. A final order, 
judgment, or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a 
creditor of the viator, adjudicating the viator bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition 
seeking reorganization of the viator or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a 
substantial part of the viator's assets.(3) The viator enters into a viatical settlement contract more 
than 2 years after the date of issuance of a policy and, with respect to the policy, at all times prior 
to the date that is 2 years after policy issuance, the following conditions are met:a. Policy 
premiums have been funded exclusively with unencumbered assets, including an interest in the 
life insurance policy being financed only to the extent of its net cash surrender value, provided 
by, or fully recourse liability incurred by, the insured or a person described in § 7502(14)c.5. of 
this title.b. There is no agreement or understanding with any other person to guarantee any such 
liability or to purchase, or stand ready to purchase, the policy, including through an assumption 
or forgiveness of the loan.c. Neither the insured nor the policy has been evaluated for 
settlement.(b) Copies of the independent evidence described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
subsection and documents required by § 7510(a) of this Act must be submitted to the insurer 
when the viatical settlement provider or other party entering into a viatical settlement contract 
with a viator submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies must be 
accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement provider that the copies are 
true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical settlement provider.(c) If the 
viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner or insured's certification 
described in § 7511(a) of this Act and the independent evidence required by paragraph (a)(2) of 
this subsection when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the 
policy or certificate to the viatical settlement provider, the copy conclusively establishes that the 
viatical settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this subsection and the insurer shall 
timely respond to the request.(d) No insurer may, as a condition of responding to a request for 
verification of coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a viatical settlement 
contract, require that the viator, insured, viatical settlement provider, or viatical settlement broker 
sign any form, disclosure, consent, or waiver form that has not been expressly approved by the 
Commissioner for use in connection with viatical settlement contracts in this State.(e) Upon 
receipt of a properly completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the 
insurer shall respond in writing within 30 calendar days with written acknowledgement 
confirming that the change has been effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change 
cannot be processed. The insurer may not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or 
beneficiary and may not otherwise seek to interfere with any viatical settlement contract lawfully 
entered into in this State. 
18 Del. C. § 7511 
Section 7512 - Prohibited practices and conflicts of interest(a) With respect to any viatical 
settlement contract or insurance policy, a viatical settlement broker may not knowingly solicit an 
offer from, effectuate a viatical settlement with, or make a sale to any viatical settlement 
provider, viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity or related provider trust that is 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such viatical settlement 
broker.(b) With respect to any viatical settlement contract or insurance policy, no viatical 
settlement provider knowingly may enter into a viatical settlement contract with a viator, if, in 
connection with such viatical settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a viatical 

settlement broker that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such viatical 
settlement provider or the viatical settlement purchaser, financing entity or related provider trust 
that is involved in such viatical settlement contract.(c) A violation of subsection (a) or subsection 
(b) of this section is a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(d) A viatical settlement provider may 
not enter into a viatical settlement contract unless the viatical settlement promotional, advertising 
and marketing materials, as may be prescribed by regulation, have been filed with the 
Commissioner. Marketing materials may not expressly reference that the insurance is "free" for 
any period of time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause a 
viator to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time is a violation of this 
Act.(e) A life insurance producer, insurance company, viatical settlement broker, or viatical 
settlement provider may not make any statement or representation to the applicant or 
policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that 
the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in 
the policy. 
18 Del. C. § 7512 
Section 7513 - Advertising for viatical settlements(a) The purpose of this section is to provide 
prospective viators with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of viatical 
settlements and to assure the clear, truthful, and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, 
limitations, and exclusions of any viatical settlement contract bought or sold. This purpose is 
intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and 
impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical settlements to assure that product 
descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or misleading advertising 
and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of viatical settlements through the 
advertising media and material used by viatical settlement licensees.(b) This section applies to 
any advertising of viatical settlement contracts or related products or services intended for 
dissemination in this State, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this State. 
Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section must 
be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever 
possible.(c) Every viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system 
of control over the content, form and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its 
contracts, products, and services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, 
designed, or presented, are the responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the 
individual who created or presented the advertisement. A system of control must include regular 
routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the viatical 
settlement licensee who disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for 
approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement 
licensee.(d) Advertisements must be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The 
form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract or product or service must 
be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. The advertisement must not have the 
capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or 
tendency to mislead or deceive must be determined by the Commissioner from the overall 
impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average 
education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(e) Certain 
viatical settlement advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are 
prohibited. Those advertisements include the following representations:(1) "Guaranteed," "fully 

secured," "100 percent secured," "fully insured," "secure," "safe," "backed by rated insurance 
companies," "backed by federal law," "backed by state law," or "state guaranty funds," or similar 
representations.(2) "No risk," "minimal risk," "low risk," "no speculation," "no fluctuation," or 
similar representations.(3) "Qualified or approved for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 
Roth IRAs, 401(k) plans, simplified employee pensions (SEP), 403(b), Keogh plans, TSA, other 
retirement account rollovers," "tax deferred," or similar representations.(4) Utilization of the 
word "guaranteed" to describe the fixed return, annual return, principal, earnings, profits, 
investment, or similar representations.(5) "No sales charges or fees" or similar 
representations.(6) "High yield," "superior return," "excellent return," "high return," "quick 
profit," or similar representations.(7) Purported favorable representations or testimonials about 
the benefits of viatical settlement contracts as an investment, taken out of context from 
newspapers, trade papers, journals, radio and television programs, and all other forms of print 
and electronic media.(f) The information required to be disclosed under this section may not be 
minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text 
of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.(1) An advertisement may not omit 
material information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission 
or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving viators as to the nature or 
extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence. The 
fact that the viatical settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to 
consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied 
or that the viatical settlement contract includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal 
requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.(2) An advertisement may not use the 
name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has 
been approved by the insurer.(3) An advertisement may not represent that premium payments 
will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that is the subject of a viatical 
settlement contract in order to maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.(4) An advertisement 
may not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is 
unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper practice.(5) The words "free," "no 
cost," "without cost," "no additional cost," at no extra cost," or words of similar import may not 
be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the 
charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or use other 
appropriate language.(6) Testimonials, appraisals, or analysis used in advertisements must be 
genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the viatical settlement 
contract, product or service advertised, if any; and be accurately reproduced with sufficient 
completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators as to the nature or scope of 
the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement. In using testimonials, appraisals, or 
analysis, a licensee under this Act makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the 
statements are subject to all the provisions of this section.a. If the individual making a 
testimonial, appraisal, analysis or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use 
of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity 
as a stockholder, director, officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or 
indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact must be prominently disclosed in the 
advertisement.b. An advertisement may not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract, 
benefit, or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association, 
or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization 
and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or 

testimonial is owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives any 
payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making an endorsement 
or testimonial, that fact must be disclosed in the advertisement.c. When an endorsement refers to 
benefits received under a viatical settlement contract, all pertinent information must be retained 
for a period of 5 years after its use.(g) An advertisement may not contain statistical information 
unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an 
advertisement must be identified.(h) An advertisement may not disparage insurers, viatical 
settlement providers, viatical settlement brokers, insurance producers, policies, services, or 
methods of marketing.(i) The name of the viatical settlement licensee must be clearly identified 
in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contract, products or services, 
and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical settlement contract must 
be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is 
part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider must be shown on the 
application.(j) An advertisement may not use a trade name, group designation, name of the 
parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the viatical 
settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing 
the name of the viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or 
tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee, or to 
create the impression that a company other than the viatical settlement licensee would have any 
responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract.(k) An 
advertisement may not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by 
their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination 
of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise 
appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the 
solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency.(l) An 
advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the 
advertisement appears, if it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that competing 
viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to 
consult the licensee's web site or contact the Department of Insurance to find out if the state 
requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker is 
licensed.(m) An advertisement may not create the impression that the viatical settlement 
provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, desirability, or 
advisability of its viatical settlement contracts forms are recommended or endorsed by any 
government entity.(n) The name of the actual licensee must be stated in all of its advertisements. 
An advertisement may not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or 
controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that 
would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual 
licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any 
responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(o) An advertisement may not directly 
or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the State or of the United States 
government endorses, approves, or favors any of the following:(1) Any viatical settlement 
licensee or its business practices or methods of operation.(2) The merits, desirability or 
advisability of any viatical settlement contract.(3) Any viatical settlement contract.(4) Any life 
insurance policy or life insurance company.(p) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which 
the viatication will occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed 
application to the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the 

viator.(q) If the advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising 
must disclose the average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators 
contracting with the licensee during the past 6 months.

person filing the report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice.(3) A person 
furnishing information as identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection is entitled to an award of 
attorney's fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil lawsuit for libel, slander, or

lawsuit at the time that it was initiated. However, such an award does not apply to any person
