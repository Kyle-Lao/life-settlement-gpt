completing an examination of a licensee under this chapter, the commissioner may examine or 
investigate any person, or the business of any person, in so far as the examination or 
investigation is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the 
examination of the licensee.(3) In lieu of an examination under this chapter of any foreign or 
alien licensee licensed in this state, the commissioner may, at the commissioner's discretion, 
accept an examination report on the licensee as prepared by the commissioner for the licensee's 
state of domicile or port-of-entry state.(4) As far as practical, the examination of a foreign or 
alien licensee shall be made in cooperation with the insurance supervisory officials of other 
states in which the licensee transacts business.(b)Record Retention Requirements.(1) A person 
required to be licensed by this chapter shall for five (5) years retain copies of all: (A) Proposed, 
offered or executed contracts, purchase agreements, underwriting documents, policy forms and 
applications from the date of the proposal, offer or execution of the contract or purchase 
agreement, whichever is later;(B) All checks, drafts or other evidence and documentation related 
to the payment, transfer, deposit or release of funds from the date the transaction; and(C) All 
other records and documents related to the requirements of this chapter.(2) This subsection (b) 
does not relieve a person of the obligation to produce these documents to the commissioner after 
the retention period has expired if the person has retained the documents.(3) Records required to 
be retained by this subsection (b) must be legible and complete and may be retained in paper, 
photograph, microprocess, magnetic, mechanical or electronic media, or by any process that 
accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for the reproduction of a record.(c)Conduct of 
Examinations.(1) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the 

commissioner shall issue an examination warrant appointing one (1) or more examiners to 
perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting 
the examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the 
examiners handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). 
The commissioner may also employ such other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner 
may deem appropriate.(2) Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, its 
officers, directors and agents shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient and free access at 
all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, assets and 
computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business and affairs of the licensee 
being examined. The officers, directors, employees and agents of the licensee or person shall 
facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The 
refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to submit to examination or 
to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for 
suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage 
in the viatical settlement business or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. 
Any proceedings for suspension, revocation or refusal of any license or authority shall be 
conducted pursuant to ยง 56-2-305.(3) The commissioner shall have the power to issue 
subpoenas, to administer oaths and to examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent 
to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner 
may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an 
order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to 
obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court.(4) When making an examination 
under this chapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, 
independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the 
reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the 
examination.(5) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's 
authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory 
action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made 
pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory 
action.(6) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's 
authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, 
any examiner or licensee work papers or other documents, or any other information discovered 
or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory 
action which the commissioner may, in the commissioner's sole discretion, deem 
appropriate.(d)Examination Reports.(1) Examination reports shall be comprised of only facts 
appearing upon the books, records or other documents of the licensee, its agents or other persons 
examined, or as ascertained from the testimony of its officers or agents or other persons 
examined concerning its affairs, and such conclusions and recommendations as the examiners 
find reasonably warranted from the facts.(2) No later than sixty (60) days following completion 
of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the commissioner a verified written 
report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified report, the commissioner shall 
transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a notice that shall afford the licensee 
examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty (30) days to make a written 
submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report.(3) In the 
event the commissioner determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an 
examination, the commissioner may initiate any proceedings or actions provided by 

law.(e)Confidentiality of Examination Information.(1) Names and individual identification 
data for all viators shall be considered private and confidential information and shall not be 
disclosed by the commissioner, unless specifically required by law.(2)(A) Except as otherwise 
provided in this chapter, all examination reports, working papers, recorded information, 
documents and copies thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any 
other person in the course of an examination made under this chapter, or in the course of analysis 
or investigation by the commissioner of the financial condition or market conduct of a licensee 
shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to ยง 10-7-503, shall not be 
subject to subpoena and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private 
civil action. The commissioner is authorized to use the documents, materials or other information 
in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official 
duties. All examination reports, working papers, recorded information, documents and their 
copies produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the

following: (i) An administrative proceeding brought by the commissioner under this 
chapter;(ii) A judicial review proceeding authorized under this chapter brought by an insurer to 
whom the records relate; or(iii) An action or proceeding that arises out of the criminal laws of

includes the law of another state or jurisdiction that is substantially similar to this 
chapter.(3) Documents, materials or other information, including, but not limited to, all working 
papers, and copies thereof, in the possession or control of the NAIC and its affiliates and 
subsidiaries shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to subpoena, and 
shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action if they

subsidiaries in the course of assisting an examination made under this chapter, or assisting a 
commissioner in the analysis or investigation of the financial condition or market conduct of a 
licensee; or(B) Disclosed to the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries under subdivision (e)(4) 
by a commissioner.(4) Neither the commissioner nor any person that received the documents, 
material or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner, including the 
NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, shall be permitted to testify in any private civil action 
concerning any confidential documents, materials or information subject to subdivision 
(e)(1).(5) In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's duties, the 
commissioner: (A) May share documents, materials or other information, including the 
confidential and privileged documents, materials or information subject to subdivision (e)(1), 
with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, with the NAIC and its affiliates 
and subsidiaries, and with state, federal and international law enforcement authorities; provided, 
that the recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the document, 
material, communication or other information;(B) May receive documents, materials, 
communications or information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, 
materials or information, from the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and from regulatory 
and law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as 
confidential or privileged any document, material or information received with notice or the 
understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the jurisdiction that is the source of the 
document, material or information; and(C) May enter into agreements governing sharing and use 

of information consistent with this subsection (e).(6) No waiver of any applicable privilege or 
claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials or information shall occur as a result of 
disclosure to the commissioner under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in 
subdivision (e)(5).(7) A privilege established under the law of any state or jurisdiction that is 
substantially similar to the privilege established under this subsection (e) shall be available and 
enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this state.(8) Nothing contained in this 
chapter shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the 
content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter 
relating thereto, to the commissioner of any other state or country, or to law enforcement 
officials of this or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time or to the 
NAIC, so long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees in 
writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this chapter.(f)Conflict of 
Interest.(1) An examiner may not be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either 
directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a 
pecuniary interest in any person subject to examination under this chapter. This subsection (f) 
shall not be construed to automatically preclude an examiner from being:(A) A viator;(B) An 
insured in a viaticated insurance policy; or(C) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is 
proposed to be viaticated.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (f), the 
commissioner may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified 
public accountants or other similar individuals who are independently practicing their 
professions, even though these persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained 
by persons subject to examination under this chapter.(g)Cost of Examinations. Any licensee or 
applicant examined under this chapter shall pay the proper charges incurred in such examination, 
including the expenses of the commissioner or anyone employed or contracted by the 
commissioner to assist in the examination.(h)Immunity from Liability.(1) No cause of action 
shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against the commissioner, the commissioner's 
authorized representatives or any examiner appointed by the commissioner for any statements 
made or conduct performed in good faith while carrying out this chapter.(2) No cause of action 
shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or 
delivering information or data to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized 
representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this chapter, if the act of 
communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the 
intent to deceive. This subdivision (h)(2) does not abrogate or modify in any way any common 
law or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in subdivision 
(h)(1).(3) A person identified in subdivision (h)(1) or (h)(2) shall be entitled to an award of 
attorney's fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action for libel, 
slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out this chapter and the 
party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this 
subdivision (h)(3), a proceeding is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or 
fact at the time that it was initiated.(i)Investigative Authority of the Commissioner. The 
commissioner may investigate suspected violations of this chapter or fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts and all persons engaged in the business of viatical settlements.

viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator with at least the 

following disclosures no later than the time the application for the viatical settlement contract is 
signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be provided in a separate document that is signed by 
the viator and the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, and shall provide the 
following information:(1) There are possible alternatives to viatical settlement contracts, 
including any accelerated death benefits or policy loans offered under the viator's life insurance 
policy;(2) That a viatical settlement broker represents exclusively the viator, and not the insurer 
or the viatical settlement provider, and owes a fiduciary duty to the viator, including a duty to act 
according to the viator's instructions and in the best interest of the viator;(3) Some or all of the 
proceeds of the viatical settlement may be taxable under federal income tax and state franchise 
and income taxes, and assistance should be sought from a professional tax advisor;(4) Proceeds 
of the viatical settlement could be subject to the claims of creditors;(5) Receipt of the proceeds of 
a viatical settlement may adversely affect the viator's eligibility for medicaid or other 
government benefits or entitlements, and advice should be obtained from the appropriate 
government agencies;(6) The viator has the right to rescind a viatical settlement contract before 
the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days after the date upon which the viatical settlement contract is 
executed by all parties or fifteen (15) calendar days after the viatical settlement proceeds have 
been paid to the viator, as provided in ยง 56-50-110(f). Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is 
effective only if both notice of the rescission is given and the viator repays all proceeds and any 
premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the viatical settlement within the rescission 
period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be 
deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment by the viator or the viator's estate of all 
viatical settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the 
viatical settlement within sixty (60) days of the insured's death;(7) Funds will be sent to the 
viator within three (3) business days after the viatical settlement provider has received the 
insurer's or group administrator's written acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or 
interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been 
designated;(8) Entering into a viatical settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, 
including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or 
certificate, to be forfeited by the viator. Assistance should be sought from a financial 
adviser;(9) Disclosure to a viator shall include distribution of a brochure describing the process

commissioner;(10) The disclosure document shall contain the following language:  
All medical, financial or personal information solicited or obtained by a viatical settlement 
provider or viatical settlement broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or the 
identity of family members, a spouse or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to 
effect the viatical settlement between the viator and the viatical settlement provider. If you are 
asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information 
may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may 
be asked to renew your permission to share information every two (2) years. 
(11) Following execution of a viatical contract, the insured may be contacted for the purpose of 
determining the insured's health status and to confirm the insured's residential or business street 
address and telephone number, or as otherwise provided in this chapter. This contact shall be 
limited to once every three (3) months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one (1) 
year, and no more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one (1) year or 

less. All such contacts shall be made only by a viatical settlement provider licensed in the state in 
which the viator resided at the time of the viatical settlement and contract, or by the authorized 
representative of a duly licensed viatical settlement provider.(b) A viatical settlement provider 
shall provide the viator with at least the following disclosures no later than the date the viatical 
settlement contract is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in 
the viatical settlement contract or in a separate document signed by the viator and shall provide 
the following information:(1) The affiliation, if any, between the viatical settlement provider and 
the issuer of the insurance policy to be viaticated;(2) The document shall include the name, 
business address and telephone number of the viatical settlement provider;(3) If an insurance

the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and shall be advised to consult 
with the viator's insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice on the proposed 
viatical settlement;(4) State the dollar amount of the current death benefit payable to the viatical 
settlement provider under the policy or certificate. If known, the viatical settlement provider 
shall also disclose the availability of any additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar 
amount of any accidental death and dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate and 
the extent to which the viator's interest in those benefits will be transferred as a result of the 
viatical settlement contract; and(5) State whether the funds will be escrowed with an independent 
third party during the transfer process, and if so, provide the name, business address and 
telephone number of the independent third party escrow agent, and the fact that the viator or 
owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or 
documents.(c) A viatical settlement broker shall provide the viator with at least the following 
disclosures no later than the date the viatical settlement contract is signed by all parties. The 
disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in the viatical settlement contract or in a separate 
document signed by the viator and shall provide the following information:(1) The name, 
business address and telephone number of the viatical settlement broker;(2) A full, complete and 
accurate description of all offers, counter-offers, acceptances and rejections relating to the 
proposed viatical settlement contract;(3) A written disclosure of any affiliations or contractual

includes anything of value paid or given to a viatical settlement broker for the placement of a 
policy.(d) If the viatical settlement provider transfers ownership or changes the beneficiary of the 
insurance policy, the provider shall communicate in writing the change in ownership or 
beneficiary to the insured within twenty (20) days after the change.(e) A viatical settlement 
provider or its viatical settlement investment agent shall provide the viatical settlement purchaser 
with at least the following disclosures prior to the date the viatical settlement purchase agreement 
is signed by all parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in any viatical purchase 
contract or in a separate document signed by the viatical settlement purchaser and viatical 
settlement provider or viatical settlement investment agent, and shall make the following 
disclosure to the viatical settlement purchaser: (1) The purchaser will receive no returns, i.e., no 
dividends and interest, until the insured dies and a death claim payment is made;(2) The actual 
annual rate of return on a viatical settlement contract is dependent upon an accurate projection of 
the insured's life expectancy, and the actual date of the insured's death. An annual guaranteed 
rate of return is not determinable;(3) The viaticated life insurance contract should not be 

considered a liquid purchase since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity and 
the funds probably are not available until the death of the insured. There is no established 
secondary market for resale of these products by the purchaser;(4) The purchaser may lose all 
benefits or may receive substantially reduced benefits if the insurer goes out of business during 
the term of the viatical investment;(5) The purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance 
premium or other costs related to the policy, if required by the terms of the viatical purchase 
agreement. These payments may reduce the purchaser's return. If a party other than the purchaser 
is responsible for the payment, the name and address of that party also shall be disclosed;(6) The 
purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance premiums or other costs related to the 
policy if the insured returns to health. Disclose the amount of such premiums, if

purchaser is entitled to a refund of all or part of the purchaser's investment under the settlement 
contract if the policy is later determined to be null and void;(10) Disclose that group policies 
may contain limitations or caps in the conversion rights, additional premiums may have to be 
paid if the policy is converted, name the party responsible for the payment of the additional 
premiums and, if a group policy is terminated and replaced by another group policy, state that 
there may be no right to convert the original coverage;(11) Disclose the risks associated with 
policy contestability, including, but not limited to, the risk that the purchaser will have no claim 
or only a partial claim to death benefits should the insurer rescind the policy within the 
contestability period;(12) Disclose whether the purchaser will be the owner of the policy in 
addition to being the beneficiary, and if the purchaser is the beneficiary only and not also the 
owner, the special risks associated with that status, including, but not limited to, the risk that the 
beneficiary may be changed or the premium may not be paid;(13) Describe the experience and 
qualifications of the person who determines the life expectancy of the insured, i.e., in-house 
staff, independent physicians and specialty firms that weigh medical and actuarial data, the 
information this projection is based on, and the relationship of the projection maker to the 
viatical settlement provider, if any; and(14) Disclosure to an investor shall include distribution of 
a brochure describing the process of investment in viatical settlements. The NAIC's form for the 
brochure shall be used unless one is developed by the commissioner.(f) A viatical settlement 
provider or its viatical settlement investment agent shall provide the viatical settlement purchaser 
with at least the following disclosures no later than at the time of the assignment, transfer or sale 
of all or a portion of an insurance policy. The disclosures shall be contained in a document 
signed by the viatical settlement purchaser and viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement 
investment agent, and shall make the following disclosures to the viatical settlement 
purchaser:(1) Disclose all the life expectancy certifications obtained by the provider in the 
process of determining the price paid to the viator;(2) State whether premium payments or other 
costs related to the policy have been escrowed. If escrowed, state the date upon which the 
escrowed funds will be depleted and whether the purchaser will be responsible for payment of 
premiums thereafter and, if so, the amount of the premiums;(3) State whether premium payments 
or other costs related to the policy have been waived. If waived, disclose whether the investor 
will be responsible for payment of the premiums if the insurer that wrote the policy terminates 
the waiver after purchase and the amount of those premiums;(4) Disclose the type of policy 
offered or sold, i.e., whole life, term life, universal life or a group policy certificate, any 
additional benefits contained in the policy and the current status of the policy;(5) If the policy is 

term insurance, disclose the special risks associated with term insurance including, but not 
limited to, the purchaser's responsibility for additional premiums if the viator continues the term 
policy at the end of the current term;(6) State whether the policy is contestable;(7) State whether 
the insurer that wrote the policy has any additional rights that could negatively affect or 
extinguish the purchaser's rights under the viatical settlement contract, what these rights are and 
under what conditions these rights are activated; and(8) State the name and address of the person 
responsible for monitoring the insured's condition. Describe how often the monitoring of the 
insured's condition is done, how the date of death is determined and how and when this 
information will be transmitted to the purchaser.(g) The viatical settlement purchase agreement 
is voidable by the purchaser at any time within three (3) days after the disclosures mandated by 
subsections (e) and (f) are received by the purchaser.

Section 56-50-109 - Disclosure to insurer 
Prior to the initiation of a plan, transaction or series of transactions, a viatical settlement broker 
or viatical settlement provider shall fully disclose to an insurer a plan, transaction or series of 
transactions to which the viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider is a party, to 
originate, renew, continue or finance a life insurance policy with the insurer for the purpose of 
engaging in the business of viatical settlements at anytime prior to or during the first five (5) 
years after issuance of the policy. The insurer shall not disclose this information to any other 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, including those affiliates of the insurer 
engaged in viatical settlement activity. 
T.C.A. ยง 56-50-109 
Section 56-50-110 - General rules(a)(1) A viatical settlement provider entering into a viatical 
settlement contract shall first obtain: (A) If the viator is the insured, a written statement from a 
licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue 
influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract; and(B) A document in which the insured 
consents to the release of the insured's medical records to a licensed viatical settlement provider, 
viatical settlement broker and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy 
covering the life of the insured.(2) Within twenty (20) days after a viator executes documents 
necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within twenty (20) days of entering 
any agreement, option, promise or any other form of understanding, expressed or implied, to 
viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that 
issued the insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. The notice 
shall be accompanied by the documents required by subdivision (a)(3).(3) The viatical provider 
shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under subdivision (a)(1)(B), a copy of the 
viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice required under subdivision 
(a)(2) and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life policy that is the 
subject of the viatical transaction. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) 
form for verification of coverage shall be used unless another form is developed and approved by 
the commissioner.(4) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage 
submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker 
within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, 
based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an 

investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The 
insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on a NAIC form or any other 
form approved by the commissioner. The insurer shall accept an original or facsimile or 
electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the viator. Failure 
by the insurer to meet its obligations under this subdivision (a)(4) shall be a violation of ยงยง 56-
50-111(c) and 56-50-116.(5) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement 
contract, the viatical settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator 
consents to the viatical settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and complete 
understanding of the viatical settlement contract, that the viator has a full and complete 
understanding of the benefits of the life insurance policy, acknowledges that the viator is 
entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a 
terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic 
illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the life insurance 
policy was issued.(6) If a viatical settlement broker performs any of these activities required of 
the viatical settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this 
section.(b) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the 
applicable state laws relating to confidentiality of medical information.(c) The viator has the 
right to rescind a viatical settlement contract before the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days after 
the date upon which the viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or fifteen (15) 
calendar days after the viatical settlement proceeds have been paid to the viator, as provided in 
subsection (f). Rescission, if exercised by the viator, is effective only if both notice of the 
rescission is given, and the viator repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest 
paid on account of the viatical settlement within the rescission period. If the insured dies during 
the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, 
subject to repayment by the viator or the viator's estate of all viatical settlement proceeds and any 
premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the viatical settlement within sixty (60) 
days of the insured's death.(d) The purchaser shall have the right to rescind a viatical settlement 
contract within three (3) days after the disclosures mandated by ยง 56-50-108(d) and (e) are 
received by the purchaser.(e) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the 
executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in 
beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three (3) business days after the 
date the escrow agent receives the document or from the date the viatical settlement provider 
receives the documents, if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, 
the provider shall pay or transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement into an escrow or trust 
account maintained in a state or federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are 
insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement 
proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in 
ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or 
related provider trust or other designated representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon 
the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of 
ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow 
agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.(f) Failure to tender consideration to the 
viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to 
ยง 56-50-108(a)(7) renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack of 
consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds shall 
be deemed sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent 

either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via 
the United States postal service or other nationally recognized delivery service.(g) Contacts with 
the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the viatical

with viatical settlement contracts in this state.(e) Upon receipt of a properly completed request 
for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in writing within 
thirty (30) calendar days with written acknowledgement confirming that the change has been 
effected or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be processed. The insurer 
shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary and shall not 
otherwise seek to interfere with any viatical settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state.

cause a viator to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be 
considered a violation of this chapter.(i) No life insurance producer, insurance company, viatical 
settlement broker, viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement investment agent shall make

Section 56-50-113 - Advertising for viatical settlements and viatical settlement purchase 
agreements(a) This section shall apply to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts, viatical 
settlement purchase agreements or related products or services intended for dissemination in this 
state, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. Where disclosure 
requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as 
to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.(b) Every viatical 
settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control over the content, 
form and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products and services. 
All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed or presented, shall be the 
responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or 
presented the advertisement. A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at 
least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the viatical settlement licensee that 
disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of 
any advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement licensee.(c) Advertisements shall be 
truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement 
of a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, product or service 
shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not have the capacity or 
tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to 
mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the 
advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or 
intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(d) Certain viatical settlement 
advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are prohibited. False and 
misleading viatical settlement advertisements include, but are not limited to, the following 
representations: (1) "Guaranteed", "fully secured", "100 percent secured", "fully insured", 
"secure", "safe", "backed by rated insurance companies", "backed by federal law", "backed by 
state law", or "state guaranty funds" or similar representations;(2) "No risk", "minimal risk", 
"low risk", "no speculation", "no fluctuation" or similar representations;(3) "Qualified or 
approved for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, 401(k) plans, simplified 
employee pensions (SEP), 403(b), Keogh plans, tax sheltered annuity TSA, other retirement 
account rollovers", "tax deferred" or similar representations;(4) Utilization of the word 
"guaranteed" to describe the fixed return, annual return, principal, earnings, profits, investment 
or similar representations;(5) "No sales charges or fees" or similar representations;(6) "High 

yield", "superior return", "excellent return", "high return", "quick profit" or similar 
representations; and(7) Purported favorable representations or testimonials about the benefits of 
viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase agreements as an investment, taken 
out of context from newspapers, trade papers, journals, radio and television programs and all 
other forms of print and electronic media.(e) The information required to be disclosed under this 
chapter shall not be minimized, rendered obscure or presented in an ambiguous fashion or 
intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading. (1) An 
advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, statements, references 
or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency or effect of misleading or 
deceiving viators, purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the nature or extent of any benefit, 
loss covered, premium payable or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical 
settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement offered is made available for 
inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the 
viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not 
remedy misleading statements.(2) An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life 
insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the 
insurer.(3) An advertisement shall not represent that premium payments will not be required to 
be paid on the life insurance policy that is the subject of a viatical settlement contract or viatical 
settlement purchase agreement in order to maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.(4) An 
advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a 
policy loan is unfair, inequitable or in any manner an incorrect or improper practice.(5) The 
words "free", "no cost", "without cost", "no additional cost", "at no extra cost" or words of 
similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An 
advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is 
included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(6)(A) Testimonials, appraisals or 
analysis used in advertisements must:(i) Be genuine;(ii) Represent the current opinion of the 
author;(iii) Be applicable to the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement, product or service advertised, if any; and(iv) Be accurately reproduced with sufficient 
completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators or purchasers as to the nature 
or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis or endorsement.(B) In using testimonials, 
appraisals or analysis, a licensee under this chapter makes as its own all the statements contained 
therein, and the statements are subject to this section.(C) If the individual making a testimonial, 
appraisal, analysis or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the 
testimonial, appraisal, analysis or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a 
stockholder, director, officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or 
indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the 
advertisement.(D) An advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract or 
viatical settlement purchase agreement, benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a 
group of individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the fact and unless 
any relationship between an organization and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the 
entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled or managed by the viatical 
settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement 
licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the 
advertisement.(E) When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement 
contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, all pertinent information shall be retained for 

a period of five (5) years after its use.(f) An advertisement shall not contain statistical 
information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used 
in an advertisement shall be identified.(g) An advertisement shall not disparage insurers, viatical 
settlement providers, viatical settlement brokers, viatical settlement investment agents, insurance 
producers, policies, services or methods of marketing.(h) The name of the viatical settlement 
licensee shall be clearly identified in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical 
settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreements, products or services, and if any 
specific viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement is advertised, the 
viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement shall be identified either by 
form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is part of the advertisement, 
the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be shown on the application.(i) An 
advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of a 
viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the viatical settlement licensee, 
service mark, slogan, symbol or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the 
viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead 
or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee or to create the impression 
that a company other than the viatical settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the 
financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement.(j) An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols or physical 
materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color or other characteristics are so similar to 
a combination of words, symbols or physical materials used by a government program or agency 
or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators or 
purchasers into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government 
program or agency.(k) An advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed 
in the state where the advertisement appears; provided, that it does not exaggerate that fact or 
suggest or imply that a competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The 
advertisement may ask the audience to consult the licensee's web site or contact the department 
of insurance to find out if the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement 
provider, viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement investment agent is licensed.(l) An 
advertisement shall not create the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its financial 
condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, desirability or advisability of its 
viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase agreement forms are recommended 
or endorsed by any government entity.(m) The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all 
of its advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name 
of any affiliate or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol or other device 
in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity 
of the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would 
have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(n) An advertisement shall not 
directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the 
United States government endorses, approves or favors:(1) Any viatical settlement licensee or its 
business practices or methods of operation;(2) The merits, desirability or advisability of any 
viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement;(3) Any viatical settlement 
contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement; or(4) Any life insurance policy or life 
insurance company.(o) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will 
occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed application to the 
date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(p) If the 

advertising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the 
average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the 
licensee during the past six (6) months.

statement:  
Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance, viatical 
settlement contract or a viatical settlement purchase agreement is guilty of a crime and may be 
subject to fines and confinement in prison. 
(2) The lack of a statement as required in subdivision (b)(1) does not constitute a defense in any 
prosecution for a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(c)Mandatory Reporting of Fraudulent 
Viatical Settlement Acts.(1) Any person engaged in the business of viatical settlements having 
knowledge or a reasonable suspicion that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be or 
has been committed shall provide to the commissioner such information as required by, and in a 
manner prescribed by, the commissioner.(2) Any other person having knowledge or a reasonable 
belief that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has been committed may 
provide to the commissioner the information required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the 
commissioner.(d)Immunity from Liability.(1) No civil liability shall be imposed on and no 
cause of action shall arise from a person's furnishing information concerning suspected,

commissioner's employees, agents or representatives;(B) Federal, state or local law enforcement

shall not apply to statements made with actual malice. In an action brought against a person for 
filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent viatical settlement act, the 
party bringing the action shall plead specifically any allegation that subdivision (d)(1) does not 
apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information did so with actual 
malice.(3) A person furnishing information as identified in subdivision (d)(1) shall be entitled to 
an award of attorney's fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil cause of action 
for libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out this chapter and 

the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this 
subdivision (d)(3), a proceeding is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or 
fact at the time that it was initiated. However, such an award does not apply to any person
