settlement provider enters into a viatical settlement contract that allows the viator to retain an 

interest in the life insurance policy, the viatical settlement contract must contain the

APPENDIX A Selling Your Life Insurance Policy 
Today it's possible for you to sell your life insurance policy to someone else (a viatical 
settlement provider) for an immediate cash payment. This financial arrangement, known as a 
viatical settlement, is best suited for people who are living with an immediate life-threatening 
illness and facing tough financial choices. 
It may not always be in your best interest to sell your life insurance policy. Before you take 
action, you should be sure you understand 
* what future benefits you may lose; and 
* what other options may be available 
Selling your life insurance policy is a complex financial arrangement. This guide will help you 
make an informed decision. 
We recommend that you 
1. evaluate your needs;2. check all your options;3. understand how the process works;4. know 
your rights; and5. check with the Alaska Division of Insurance. 
Step 1. Evaluate your needs Before you sell your policy and give up valuable insurance 
protection, think about whether your need for life insurance has changed since you bought the 

policy. If it hasn't, selling your policy may not be the right choice. If you sell your policy now, 
your beneficiaries will not be paid a benefit at your death. 
If you sell your policy now, remember premiums go up a lot as you grow older. You may not 
want to pay the higher cost to replace your coverage later. 
Step 2. Check all of your options You may be able to get the cash you need now without selling 
your policy. 
Policy Cash Values 
Contact your current life insurance agent or company to see if you have any cash value in your 
policy. Ask if you can 
(1) borrow from the cash value and still keep the insurance in force;(2) cancel the policy for its 
current cash value; or(3) use the cash value as collateral to get a loan from a financial institution. 
Your insurance company must tell you about your options if you ask. 
Accelerated Death Benefits 
Find out if your policy has an "accelerated death benefit." It may be your best option. 
Many life insurance policies do have an accelerated death benefit. With that benefit, 
policyholders who are terminally ill, affected with certain diseases, or permanently confined in a 
nursing home can access 50 percent or more of a policy's death benefit while still living. An 
accelerated death benefit could pay you a large part of your policy's death benefit and you could 
keep your policy. 
A very important feature of the accelerated benefit is that when the policyholder dies, the 
beneficiaries get the remaining death benefit. This means that eventually 100 percent of the 
policy benefits will be paid out either to the insured or the beneficiary. 
Other Considerations 
Think about what it will mean if you do sell your policy. Check out the tax implications. Not all 
proceeds from a viatical settlement are tax-free. 
Find out if creditors could claim any of the money you would get from a viatical settlement. 
Find out if you will lose any public assistance benefits such as medicaid or other government 
benefits if you accept a cash settlement for your life insurance policy. 
Comparison Shop 
To learn the market value of your policy, it's a good idea to contact three to five viatical 
settlement providers. Or you could use a viatical settlement broker who would contact several 

viatical settlement providers for you. Your financial advisor can help you decide whether to 
work with a viatical settlement provider or through a viatical settlement broker. 
Summary 
Everyone's financial situation is different. A viatical settlement may or may not be the best 
approach for you. Check it out for yourself. We recommend that you ask an advisor who is 
qualified to review your finances to help you review your options. 
Step 3. How the process works If you decide to sell your life insurance policy to a viatical 
settlement provider, you will enter into a viatical settlement agreement with the provider. You, 
the seller, agree to accept a cash payment for your policy. The amount will be less than the face 
amount the policy would pay upon your death. (For example, you might agree to accept a 
$75,000 cash payment for a $100,000 policy.) 
The viatical settlement provider buying your policy 
* becomes the new owner of your policy; 
* names the beneficiary; 
* collects the full death benefit when you die; 
* begins paying premiums on the policy; and 
* may sell your policy again. 
There are four basic phases required to complete a viatical transaction. 
Phase 1 - Qualifying to sell your policy (underwriting) 
The viatical settlement provider will need information about you before making an offer. 
Usually, the viatical settlement provider will take some preliminary information from you over 
the phone and send you this paperwork to sign: 
* a medical release form so the viatical settlement provider can get and review your medical 
records; 
* an authorization form to contact your insurance company to confirm benefit, premium, and 
ownership of your policy. 
To avoid delays, it's important that you give complete and accurate information about your 
medical history. 
If you apply with more than one viatical settlement provider, each will contact your doctor for 
medical records and your insurance company for policy information. 

Phase 2 - Calculating the offer 
The viatical settlement provider uses the information it gets in the underwriting phase to make an 
offer. To develop an offer, a viatical settlement provider takes into account various factors 
including 
* estimated life expectancy and medical condition of the insured; generally, the shorter the life 
expectancy of the insured, the more the viatical settlement provider will offer for the policy; 
* the amount of life insurance coverage; 
* loans or advances, if any, previously taken against the policy; 
* amount of premiums necessary to keep the life insurance policy in force; 
* the rating of the issuing insurance company; 
* prevailing interest rates; and 
* payment restrictions. 
Phase 3 - Closing the agreement 
* If you accept an offer, a closing package is forwarded to you, the seller, for approval and 
signature. Closing documents typically include an offer letter, a viatical settlement contract, and 
the forms the insurance company needs to transfer ownership of the policy to the viatical 
settlement provider. 
* The closing documents are then returned to the viatical settlement provider for its signature. 
* The viatical settlement provider will put the cash payment owed to you in escrow, if required, 
and send the signed insurance change forms to the insurance company to record the change. 
Phase 4 - Receiving the payment 
Once the insurance company notifies the viatical settlement provider that the changes on the life 
insurance policy have been recorded, the payment is released to you, the seller, usually the next 
business day. 
Step 4. Know your rights State laws 
Alaska insurance laws provide important consumer protections including the following: 
* a viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider arranging viatical settlements must 
be licensed with the Alaska Division of Insurance; 

* with few exceptions, the viatical settlement provider buying your policy must keep your 
identity and medical history confidential unless you give written consent to tell others; 
* to protect your proceeds, the viatical settlement provider buying your policy must put your 
money into an escrow account with an independent party during the transfer process; 
* you have the right to change your mind about the settlement within 15 days AFTER you 
receive the money, provided you return all the money; 
* the new owners of your policy are limited in how often they may contact you about your health 
status. 
Federal tax laws 
Two groups of people might receive benefits from a viatical settlement without owing federal 
income tax: 
* persons who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and with a life expectancy of 24 
months or less; 
* certain chronically ill individuals. Before entering into a viatical settlement, consult your own 
financial advisor or tax attorney about the federal tax consequences. 
Avoiding Consumer Fraud 
* If you're in good health and someone asks you to sell your life insurance policy, proceed with 
caution. Refer to the section on selling your life insurance policy. 
* If you've been contacted by someone who wants you to buy a policy and then sell it 
immediately, you should contact the Alaska Division of Insurance. You may be a target for 
fraud. 
* If you're asked to buy a life insurance policy for the sole purpose of selling it, you may be 
participating in fraud. Contact the Alaska Division of Insurance to report the request and to 
obtain information. 
* If you're asked to invest in a viatical settlement, we recommend that you contact the Alaska 
Division of Insurance to learn more about the issues and risks that might be involved in such an 
investment. 
Step 5. Check with the Alaska Division of Insurance State Licensing For a complete list of 
authorized viatical settlement providers, viatical settlement brokers, and viatical settlement 
representatives, call the Alaska Division of Insurance.

Before you sell your policy be sure you know the answers to these questions. 
Evaluating Your Needs 
* Do you still need life insurance? 
* Do you have dependents who might rely on your life insurance benefits should anything 
happen to you? 
* If you don't need life insurance protection now, what are the chances you'll need it in the 
future?

* Can you borrow from the cash value? 
* Can you cancel the policy for its current cash value? 
* Can you use the cash value as collateral to get a loan from a financial institution? 
* Do you have art accelerated death benefit feature? 
Taxes and Other Financial Considerations 
* Is the money you get from selling the policy taxable? 
* Will the money you get from selling the policy affect your eligibility for government benefits? 
* Do you need the advice of a tax or estate-planning specialist before you decide to sell your 
policy? 
* If you sell your policy, can any of your creditors claim the money? 
Understanding the Process 
* If you sell your policy, who will be the legal owner? 
* Is the viatical settlement provider buying your policy licensed? 
* If you sell your policy, how will the value you get be calculated? 
What interest rate will be used? 
* If you sell your policy but then change your mind, can you get your money back? 
* Will investors have specific information about you, your family, or your health status? 

* How are fees or commissions paid to the viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement 
provider?
