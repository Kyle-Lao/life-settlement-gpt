nonresident license applicant with a valid viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement 
broker license from the applicant's home state if:(i) the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker has submitted the proper request for licensure and has paid the appropriate 
licensure fees;(ii) the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker has submitted or 
transmitted to the department the application for licensure that the person submitted to his or her 
home state; and(iii) the viatical settlement provider's or the viatical settlement broker's home

expire and may be renewed on the anniversary month of the initial date of licensure upon 
payment of the appropriate renewal fee and application with the department on a form required

coverage request shall be on a form substantially similar to the form developed by the 
department.(2) The insurer shall complete the verification of coverage form submitted by the 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker and transmit to the requesting party the 
completed verification of coverage form within a reasonable time frame, not to exceed 30 
calendar days of the date the request is received. The completed verification of coverage form 
shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer 
intends in good faith to pursue an investigation at that time regarding the validity of the 
insurance contract because of an actual or potential fraudulent viatical settlement act or other 
fraud.(3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the 
validity of any policy on the grounds of fraud.(f) Viatical settlement broker's performance 
acceptable.--If a viatical settlement broker performs the provisions enumerated in this section on 
behalf of a viatical settlement provider, the viatical settlement provider is deemed to have 
fulfilled the requirements of this section, provided that the viatical settlement provider shall 
remain responsible for any failure of the viatical settlement broker to have fulfilled the 
requirements of this section.(g) Health and financial information.--All health or financial 
information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provision of 
Federal and State law relating to confidentiality and disclosure of such 
information.(h) Rescission.--All viatical settlement contracts entered into in this State shall 
provide the viator with an unconditional right to rescind the contract for 30 days from the date of 
contract and at least 15 calendar days from the receipt of the viatical settlement proceeds by the 
viator. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be 
deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the viatical settlement provider of all 
viatical settlement proceeds.(i) Transfer of proceeds.--The viatical settlement provider shall 
instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, 
assignment or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent. Within three 
business days after the date the escrow agent receives the document, the proceeds of the viatical 
settlement shall be placed into an escrow or trust account maintained in a federally or State- 
chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the 
escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary 
forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider trust. Upon the licensed provider's 
receipt of the properly completed acknowledgment of the transfer of ownership, assignment or 
designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the licensed provider shall instruct the 
escrow agent to pay the settlement proceeds to the viator. Payment shall be made within three 
business days of the date the provider received the acknowledged forms from the insurance 
company.(j) Deadline.--Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement 
contract within the time disclosed pursuant to section 7(a) or at all renders the viatical settlement 
contract voidable by the viator for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered 
to and accepted by the viator.(k) Health status.-- (1) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of 
determining the health status of the insured by the viatical settlement provider or viatical 
settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred shall only be made by the viatical 
settlement provider or broker licensed in this Commonwealth or its authorized representative and 

shall be limited to once every three months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one 
year and to no more than once per month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or 
less.(2) The viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall explain the procedure 
for these contacts at the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into.(3) The limitations set 
forth in this subsection shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons other than 
determining the insured's health status.(l) Commission.--No viatical settlement broker shall 
receive from a viatical settlement provider a fee, commission or other valuable consideration for 
services rendered to or in connection with viators residing in this Commonwealth unless the 
viatical settlement provider is licensed in this Commonwealth.(m) Prohibition.--No person who 
invests in a viaticated policy or broker or provider, including, but not limited to, a participant in a 
financing transaction, shall influence the treatment of the insured's illness.
