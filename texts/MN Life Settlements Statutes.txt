insured's identity or the identity of family members, a spouse, or a significant other may be 
disclosed as necessary to effect the viatical settlement between the viator and the viatical 
settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to 
the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides 
funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every 
two years."; and(9) following execution of a viatical contract, the insured may be contacted for 
the purpose of determining the insured's health status and to confirm the insured's residential or 
business street address and telephone number, or as otherwise provided in

between the viatical settlement provider and the viatical settlement broker;(4) if an insurance 
policy to be viaticated has been issued as a joint policy or involves family riders or any coverage

with the viator's insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice on the proposed

dies and a death claim payment is made;(2) the actual annual rate of return on a viatical 
settlement contract is dependent upon an accurate projection of the insured's life expectancy, and 
the actual date of the insured's death. An annual guaranteed rate of return is not 
determinable;(3) the viaticated life insurance contract should not be considered a liquid purchase 
since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity and the funds are probably not

these products by the purchaser;(4) the purchaser may lose all benefits or may receive 
substantially reduced benefits if the insurer goes out of business during the term of the viatical

responsible for payment of the insurance premiums or other costs related to the policy if the 
insured returns to health. Disclose the amount of the premiums, if applicable;(7) the name, 
business address, and telephone number of the independent third party providing escrow services 
and the relationship to the broker;(8) the amount of any trust fees or other expenses to be charged 
to the viatical settlement purchaser shall be disclosed;(9) whether the purchaser is entitled to a 
refund of all or part of the purchaser's investment under the settlement contract if the policy is 
later determined to be null and void;(10) that group policies may contain limitations or caps in 
the conversion rights, additional premiums may have to be paid if the policy is converted, name 
the party responsible for the payment of the additional premiums and, if a group policy is 

terminated and replaced by another group policy, state that there may be no right to convert the 
original coverage;(11) the risks associated with policy contestability including, but not limited to, 
the risk that the purchaser will have no claim or only a partial claim to death benefits should the 
insurer rescind the policy within the contestability period;(12) whether the purchaser will be the 
owner of the policy in addition to being the beneficiary, and if the purchaser is the beneficiary 
only and not also the owner, the special risks associated with that status, including, but not 
limited to, the risk that the beneficiary may be changed or the premium may not be paid; 
and(13) the experience and qualifications of the person who determines the life expectancy of the 
insured, for example, in-house staff, independent physicians, and specialty firms that weigh 
medical and actuarial data; the information this projection is based on; and the relationship of the 
projection maker to the viatical settlement provider, if any. 
Disclosure to a viatical settlement purchaser under this subdivision includes the distribution of a 
brochure describing the process of investment in viatical settlements. The National Association 
of Insurance Commissioners form for the brochure shall be used unless one is developed by the 
commissioner.

funds will be depleted and whether the purchaser will be responsible for payment of premiums 
thereafter and, if so, the amount of the premiums;(3) state whether premium payments or other 
costs related to the policy have been waived. If waived, disclose whether the investor will be 
responsible for payment of the premiums if the insurer that wrote the policy terminates the 
waiver after purchase and the amount of those premiums;(4) disclose the type of policy offered 
or sold, for example, whole life, term life, universal life, or a group policy certificate; any 
additional benefits contained in the policy; and the current status of the policy;(5) if the policy is 
term insurance, disclose the special risks associated with term insurance including, but not 
limited to, the purchaser's responsibility for additional premiums if the viator continues the term 
policy at the end of the current term;(6) state whether the policy is contestable;(7) state whether 
the insurer that wrote the policy has any additional rights that could negatively affect or 
extinguish the purchaser's rights under the viatical settlement contract, what these rights are, and 
under what conditions these rights are activated; and(8) state the name and address of the person 
responsible for monitoring the insured's condition. Describe how often the monitoring of the 
insured's condition is done, how the date of death is determined, and how and when this 
information will be transmitted to the purchaser.Subd. 7.Agreement voidable.

Section 60A.9579 - GENERAL RULESSubdivision 1.Provider requirements.(a) A viatical 
settlement provider entering into a viatical settlement contract shall first obtain:(1) if the viator is 
the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the viator is of sound 
mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a viatical settlement contract; 
and(2) a document in which the insured consents to the release of the insured's medical records 
to a licensed viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, and the insurance company 
that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.(b) Within 20 days after a 
viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within 20 
days of entering any agreement, option, promise, or any other form of understanding, expressed 
or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the 
insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. 
The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by paragraph (c).(c) The viatical 
provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under paragraph (a), clause (2), a 
copy of the viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice required under 
paragraph (b), and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life 
insurance policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners form for verification of coverage shall be used unless another form is 
developed or approved by the commissioner.(d) The insurer shall respond to a request for 
verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or 
viatical settlement broker within 30 calendar days of the date the request is received and shall 
indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to 
pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible 
fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for verification of coverage made on a National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners form or any other form approved by the commissioner. 
The insurer shall accept an original or facsimile or electronic copy of a request and any 
accompanying authorization signed by the viator. Failure by the insurer to meet its obligations 
under this subdivision is a violation of sections 60A.9581, subdivision 3, and 60A.9585.(e) Prior 
to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical settlement provider 
shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical settlement contract, 
represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the viatical settlement 
contract, that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the life insurance 
policy, acknowledges that the viator is entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and 
voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the 
insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was 
diagnosed after the life insurance policy was issued.(f) If a viatical settlement broker performs 
any of these activities required of the viatical settlement provider, the provider is deemed to have 
fulfilled the requirements of this section.Subd. 2.Confidentiality of personal information. 
All personal information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to 
sections 72A.49 to 72A.505. 
Subd. 3.General right of rescission. 
A viatical settlement contract entered into in this state shall provide the viator with an absolute 
right to rescind the contract before the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date upon which the 
viatical settlement contract is executed by all parties or 15 calendar days after the viatical 

settlement proceeds have been sent to the viator as provided in subdivision 6. Rescission by the 
viator may be conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to the viatical 
settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, 
loans, and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical settlement provider in connection with 
or as a consequence of the viatical settlement. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the 
viatical settlement contract is deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the viatical 
settlement provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, and any premiums, loans, 
and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or purchaser, which shall 
be paid within 60 calendar days of the death of the insured. In the event of any rescission, if the 
viatical settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a viatical settlement 
broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement broker shall refund all 
commissions and compensation to the viatical settlement provider within five business days 
following receipt of written demand from the viatical settlement provider, which demand shall be 
accompanied by either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the viator, or 
notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the 
applicable rescission period. 
Subd. 4.Right to rescind after mandated disclosures.

purchaser. 
Subd. 5.Payment of settlement proceeds. 
The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed documents required 
to effect the change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary directly to the 
independent escrow agent. Within three business days after the date the escrow agent receives 
the document, or from the date the viatical settlement provider receives the documents, if the 
viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the provider, the provider shall pay or 
transfer the proceeds of the viatical settlement into an escrow or trust account maintained in a 
state- or federally chartered financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the 
escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment, or 
change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider trust or other 
designated representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of 
the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment, or designation 
of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to 
the viator. 
Subd. 6.Tendering consideration. 
Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time set 
forth in the disclosure pursuant to section 60A.9577, subdivision 1, clause (6), renders the 
viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack of consideration until the time 
consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds shall be deemed sent by a viatical 
settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent either releases funds for wire 
transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator by United States mail or other 
nationally recognized delivery service. 

Subd. 7.Health status contacts. 
Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the 
viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred 
shall only be made by the viatical settlement provider or broker licensed in this state or its 
authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three months for insureds with a life 
expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per month for insureds with a life 
expectancy of one year or less. The provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these 
contacts at the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into. The limitations in this 
subdivision shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining the 
insured's health status. Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall be 
responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives.

Section 60A.9581 - PROHIBITED PRACTICES AND CONFLICTS OF 
INTERESTSubdivision 1.Solicitations and sales to controlled person.

knowingly shall solicit an offer from, effectuate a viatical settlement with, or make a sale to any 
viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement purchaser, viatical settlement investment agent, 
financing entity, or related provider trust that is controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with the viatical settlement broker unless this relationship is disclosed to the viator. 
Subd. 2.Payment to controlled broker. 
With respect to any viatical settlement contract or insurance policy, no viatical settlement 
provider knowingly may enter into a viatical settlement contract with a viator, if, in connection 
with a viatical settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a viatical settlement broker 
that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the viatical settlement provider 
or the viatical settlement purchaser, viatical settlement investment agent, financing entity, or 
related provider trust that is involved in a viatical settlement contract unless this relationship is 
disclosed to the viator. 
Subd. 3.Fraudulent viatical settlement act. 
A violation of subdivisions 1 and 2 is deemed a fraudulent viatical settlement act. 
Subd. 4.Advertising.(a) No viatical settlement provider shall enter into a viatical settlement 
contract unless the viatical settlement promotional, advertising, and marketing materials, as may 
be prescribed by rule, have been filed with the commissioner. In no event shall any marketing 
materials expressly reference that the insurance is "free" for any period of time. The inclusion of 
any reference in the marketing materials that would cause a viator to reasonably believe that the 
insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a violation of 
sections 60A.957 to 60A.9585.(b) No life insurance producer, insurance company, viatical 
settlement broker, viatical settlement provider, or viatical settlement investment agent shall make 
any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or 
financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the 
policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy.

Section 60A.9582 - ADVERTISING FOR VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS AND VIATICAL 
SETTLEMENTS PURCHASE AGREEMENTSSubdivision 1.Application. 
This section applies to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts, viatical purchase 
agreements, or related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including 
Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. Where disclosure requirements are 
established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or 
eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible. 
Subd. 2.System of control. 
Every viatical settlement licensee shall establish and at all times maintain a system of control 
over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, 
products, and services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed, or 
presented, shall be the responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the individual 
who created or presented the advertisement. A system of control shall include regular routine 
notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the viatical settlement 
licensee who disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior 
to the use of any advertisements not furnished by the viatical settlement licensee. 
Subd. 3.Form and content. 
Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and 
content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement, product, or service shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception 
and it shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement 
has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from 
the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a 
person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is 
directed. 
Subd. 4.False and misleading advertisements. 
Certain viatical settlement advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are 
prohibited. False and misleading viatical settlement advertisements include, but are not limited 
to, the following representations: 
(1) "guaranteed," "fully secured," "100 percent secured," "fully insured," "secure," "safe," 
"backed by rated insurance companies," "backed by federal law," "backed by state law," "state 
guaranty funds," or similar representations;(2) "no risk," "minimal risk," "low risk," "no 
speculation," "no fluctuation," or similar representations;(3) "qualified or approved for individual 
retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, 401(k) plans, simplified employee pensions (SEP), 
403(b), Keogh plans, TSA, other retirement account rollovers," "tax deferred," or similar 
representations;(4) utilization of the word "guaranteed" to describe the fixed return, annual 
return, principal, earnings, profits, investment, or similar representations;(5) "no sales charges or 
fees" or similar representations;(6) "high yield," "superior return," "excellent return," "high 
return," "quick profit," or similar representations; and(7) purported favorable representations or 
testimonials about the benefits of viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase 
agreements as an investment, taken out of context from newspapers, trade papers, journals, radio 
and television programs, and all other forms of print and electronic media.Subd. 5.Disclosures 

regulated.(a) The information required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, 
rendered obscure, or presented in ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the 
advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.(b) An advertisement shall not omit material 
information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use 
has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving viators, purchasers, or 
prospective purchasers as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable, 
or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract or viatical 
settlement purchase agreement offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of 
the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical 
settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement includes a "free look" period that 
satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.(c) An 
advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance 
policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the insurer.(d) An advertisement shall not 
represent that premium payments will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that 
is the subject of a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement in order 
to maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.(e) An advertisement shall not state or imply that 
interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any 
manner an incorrect or improper practice.(f) The words "free," "no cost," "without cost," "no 
additional cost," "at no extra cost," or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to 
any benefit or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a 
service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate 
language.(g) Testimonials, appraisals, or analysis used in advertisements must be genuine; 
represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the viatical settlement contract or 
viatical settlement purchase agreement product or service advertised, if any; and be accurately 
reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators or 
purchasers as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement. In 
using testimonials, appraisals, or analysis, a licensee under sections 60A.957 to 60A.9585 makes 
as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions 
of this section.(h) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement has 
a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or 
endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, officer, 
employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required union-
scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(i) An advertisement 
shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement, benefit, or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, 
association, or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an 
organization and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the 
endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, 
or receives any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making 
an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.(j) When an 
endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement 
purchase agreement, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its 
use.Subd. 6.Statistics. 
An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and 
relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified. 

Subd. 7.Disparaging advertisements. 
An advertisement shall not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, viatical settlement 
brokers, viatical settlement investment agents, insurance producers, policies, services, or 
methods of marketing. 
Subd. 8.Licensee's name. 
The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be clearly identified in all advertisements about 
the licensee or its viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreements, 
products, or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement 
purchase agreement is advertised, the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement shall be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an 
application is part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be 
shown on the application. 
Subd. 9.Licensee disclosure. 
An advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of 
a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the viatical settlement licensee, 
service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the 
viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead 
or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee, or to create the impression 
that a company other than the viatical settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the 
financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase 
agreement. 
Subd. 10.Government sponsorship; misleading advertisements. 
An advertisement shall not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by 
their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination 
of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise 
appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators or purchasers into 
believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or 
agency. 
Subd. 11.State licensure. 
An advertisement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the 
advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that a 
competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the 
audience to consult the licensee's website or contact the Department of Commerce to find out if 
the state requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement 
broker, or viatical settlement investment agent is licensed. 
Subd. 12.Government entity endorsement. 
An advertisement shall not create the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its 
financial condition or status, the payment of its claims, or the merits, desirability, or advisability 
of its viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase agreement forms are 
recommended or endorsed by any government entity. 

Subd. 13.Name. 
The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its advertisements. An advertisement 
shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of 
the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the 
capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create 
the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the 
financial obligation of the licensee. 
Subd. 14.Government approval.
