lawfully initiate the policy himself or herself or itself, and where, at the time of inception, there 
is an arrangement or agreement to directly or indirectly transfer the ownership of the policy or 
the policy benefits to a third party. Trusts that are created to give the appearance of insurable

prohibition against wagering on life. Stranger originated life insurance arrangements do not 
include those practices set forth in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (11) of this Code 
section.(25) "Terminally ill" means having an illness or sickness that can reasonably be expected

shall be maintained by the provider for three years after the death of the insured and shall be 
available to the Commissioner for inspection during reasonable business hours.(e)(1) Upon 
determining that an examination should be conducted, the Commissioner shall issue an 
examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform the examination and 
instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the examination, the examiner 
shall use methods common to the examination of any life settlement licensee and should use 
those guidelines and procedures set forth in an examiners' handbook adopted by a national 
organization. The Commissioner may also employ such other guidelines as the Commissioner 
may deem appropriate.(2) Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, its 
officers, directors, and agents shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and free access 

at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, assets, 
and computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the 
licensee being examined. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or person 
shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. 
The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to 
examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the Commissioner shall be 
grounds for suspension or refusal of or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the 
licensee to engage in the life settlement business or other business subject to the Commissioner's 
jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of any license or authority 
shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 2 of this title.(3) The Commissioner shall have the power 
to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine under oath any person as to any matter 
pertinent to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the 
Commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction and, upon proper showing, the 
court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary 
evidence.(4) When making an examination under this Code section, the Commissioner may 
retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or 
other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by 
the licensee that is the subject of the examination.(5) Nothing contained in this Code section 
shall be construed to limit the Commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an examination 
in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. 
Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima-facie 
evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(6) Nothing contained in this Code section shall be 
construed to limit the Commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any 
final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee work papers or other 
documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any 
examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the Commissioner may, in 
his or her sole discretion, deem appropriate.(f)(1) Examination reports shall be composed of (A) 
only facts appearing upon the books, records, or other documents of the licensee, its agents, or 
other persons examined or as ascertained from the testimony of the licensee's officers or agents 
or other persons examined concerning the licensee's affairs and (B) such conclusions and 
recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.(2) No later than 60 
days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the 
Commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified 
report, the Commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a 
notice that shall afford the licensee examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than 30 days 
to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination 
report and which shall become part of the report or to request a hearing on any matter in dispute 
if the Commissioner deems such written submission or rebuttal comments appropriate and 
consistent with the findings of the examination.(3) In the event the Commissioner determines 
that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an examination, the Commissioner may initiate 
any proceedings or actions provided by law.(g)(1) Names and individual identification data for 
all owners, purchasers, and insureds shall be considered private and confidential information and 
shall not be disclosed by the Commissioner unless the disclosure is to another regulator or is 
required by law.(2) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all examination reports, 
working papers, recorded information, documents, and copies thereof produced by, obtained by, 
or disclosed to the Commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made 

under this chapter or in the course of analysis or investigation by the Commissioner of the 
financial condition or market conduct of a licensee shall be confidential by law and privileged, 
shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50, shall not be subject to 
subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil 
action. The Commissioner is authorized to use the documents, materials, or other information in 
the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the Commissioner's official 
duties. The licensee being examined may have access to all documents used to make the report 
except documents and work papers that the Commissioner has deemed privileged.(h)(1) An 
examiner shall not be appointed by the Commissioner if the examiner, either directly or 
indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary 
interest in any person subject to examination under this chapter. This subsection shall not be 
construed to preclude automatically an examiner from being: (A) An owner;(B) An insured in a 
life settlement contract or insurance policy; or(C) A beneficiary in an insurance policy that is 
proposed for a life settlement contract.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, 
the Commissioner may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, 
certified public accountants, or other similar individuals who are independently practicing their 
professions even though these persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained 
by persons subject to examination under this chapter.(i)(1) No cause of action shall arise nor 
shall any liability be imposed against the Commissioner, the Commissioner's authorized 
representatives, or any examiner appointed by the Commissioner for any statements made or 
conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this chapter.(2) No cause of 
action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of 
communicating or delivering information or data to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's 
authorized representative or examiner pursuant to an examination made under this chapter if the 
act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or 
the intent to deceive. This paragraph shall not abrogate or modify in any way any common law 
or statutory privilege or immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person identified in paragraph (1) 
of this subsection.(3) A person identified in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection shall be 
entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs if he or she is the prevailing party in a civil cause 
of action for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the 
provisions of this chapter and the party bringing the action was not substantially justified in 
doing so. For purposes of this subsection, a proceeding is substantially justified if it had a 
reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it was initiated.(j) The Commissioner may 
investigate suspected fraudulent life settlement acts and persons engaged in the business of life 
settlements.

provider or broker shall provide in writing, in a separate document that is signed by the owner, 
the following information no later than the date of the application for a life settlement 
contract:(1) The fact that possible alternatives to life settlement contracts exist, including, but not 
limited to, accelerated benefits offered by the issuer of the life insurance policy;(2) The fact that

other government benefits or entitlements and that advice should be obtained from the 
appropriate agencies;(5) The fact that the owner has a right to terminate a life settlement contract 
within 15 days of the date it is executed by all parties and the owner has received the disclosures 
contained in this Code section. Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both 
notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and 
loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies 
during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to 
repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan 
interest to the provider;(6) The fact that proceeds will be sent to the owner within three business 
days after the provider has received the insurer or group administrator's acknowledgment that 
ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has 
been designated in accordance with the terms of the life settlement contract;(7) The fact that 
entering into a life settlement contract may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion 
rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate of a group 
policy, to be forfeited by the owner and that assistance should be sought from a professional 
financial adviser;(8) The method of calculating the compensation paid or to be paid to the life 
settlement broker or any other person acting for the owner in connection with the transaction, 
where the term "compensation" includes any thing of value paid or given;(9) The date by which 
the funds will be available to the owner and the transmitter of the funds;(10) The fact that the 
Commissioner shall require delivery of a buyer's guide or a similar consumer advisory package

disclosure document shall contain the following language:  
"All medical, financial, or personal information solicited or obtained by a provider or life 
settlement broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or the identity of family 
members, a spouse, or a significant other, may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life 
settlement contract between the owner and provider. If you are asked to provide this information, 
you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to someone who 
buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew your permission 
to share information every two years."; 
(12) The fact that the Commissioner shall require providers and life settlement brokers to print 
separate signed fraud warnings on their applications and on their life settlement contracts as 
follows:  

"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or life 
settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison."; 
(13) The fact that the insured may be contacted by either the provider or life settlement broker or 
its authorized representative for the purpose of determining the insured's health status or to verify 
the insured's address. This contact is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life 
expectancy of more than one year and no more than once per month if the insured has a life 
expectancy of one year or less;(14) The affiliation, if any, between the provider and the issuer of 
the insurance policy to be settled;(15) That a life settlement broker represents exclusively the 
owner, and not the insurer or the provider or any other person, and owes a fiduciary duty to the 
owner, including a duty to act according to the owner's instructions and in the best interest of the 
owner;(16) The document shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the 
provider;(17) The name, business address, and telephone number of the independent third-party 
escrow agent, and the fact that the owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or 
trust agreements or documents; and(18) The fact that a change of ownership could in the future 
limit the insured's ability to purchase future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit 
to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life.(b) The written disclosures shall be 
conspicuously displayed in any life settlement contract furnished to the owner by a provider 
including any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the provider and the life 
settlement broker.(c) A life settlement broker shall provide the owner and the provider with at 
least the following disclosures no later than the date the life settlement contract is signed by all 
parties. The disclosures shall be conspicuously displayed in the life settlement contract or in a 
separate document signed by the owner and provide the following information: (1) The name, 
business address, and telephone number of the life settlement broker;(2) A full, complete, and 
accurate description of all the offers, counter-offers, acceptances, and rejections relating to the 
proposed life settlement contract;(3) A written disclosure at the inception of the brokerage 
arrangement of any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the life settlement broker 
and any person making an offer in connection with the proposed life settlement contracts;(4) The

received by that life settlement broker, which compensation includes any thing of value paid or 
given to the life settlement broker in connection with the life settlement contract; and(5) A 
complete reconciliation of the gross offer or bid by the provider to the net amount of proceeds or 
value to be received by the owner. For the purpose of this paragraph, "gross offer or bid" means 
the total amount or value offered by the provider for the purchase of one or more life insurance 
policies, inclusive of commissions and fees.(d) The failure to provide the disclosures or rights

Section 33-59-10 - Lender-financed premiums using policy as collateral; disclosures and 
certifications(a) In addition to other questions an insurance carrier may lawfully pose to a life 
insurance applicant, insurance carriers may inquire in the application for insurance whether the 
proposed owner intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will 
use the policy as collateral to support the financing.(b) If, as described in paragraph (11) of Code 
Section 33-59-2, the loan provides funds which can be used for a purpose other than paying for 
the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the life insurance 

policy and loan, the application shall be rejected as a violation of the prohibited practices in 
Code Section 33-59-13.(c) If the financing does not violate Code Section 33-59-13 in this 
manner, the insurance carrier: (1) May make disclosures, including, but not limited to, 
disclosures such as the following, to the applicant and the insured, either on the application or an 
amendment to the application to be completed no later than the delivery of the policy:  
"If you have entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral and the policy 
changes ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the following may be 
true: 
(A) A change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;(B) A 
change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the 
insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one 
life;(C) Should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage 
on the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, or 
other factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage or may result in significantly higher 
premiums; and(D) You should consult a professional adviser since a change in ownership in 
satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure 
of the loan."; and(2) May require certifications, such as the following, from the applicant and the 
insured: (A)" I have not entered into any agreement or arrangement providing for the future sale 
of this life insurance policy;(B) My loan arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to 
pay for some or all of the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and 
maintaining my life insurance policy, but I have not entered into any agreement by which I am to 
receive consideration in exchange for procuring this policy; and(C) The borrower has an 
insurable interest in the insured."

Section 33-59-11 - Required documents and information; confidentiality; seller's right to rescind; 
escrow proceedings; failure to tender consideration; limitation on contracts with the insured for 
the purpose of determining the insured's health status(a) A provider entering into a life 
settlement contract, wherein the insured is terminally or chronically ill, shall first obtain: (1) If 
the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner 
is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a settlement contract; 
and(2) A document in which the insured consents to the release of his or her medical records to a 
provider, life settlement broker, or insurance producer and, if the policy was issued less than two 
years from the date of application for a settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued 
the policy.(b) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a 
provider, life settlement broker, or life insurance producer not later than 30 calendar days after 
the date the request is received. The request for verification of coverage must be made on a form 
approved by the Commissioner. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage 
or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In its response, the insurer shall indicate 
whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue 
an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract.(c) Before or at the 
time of execution of the settlement contract, the provider shall obtain a witnessed document in 
which the owner consents to the settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and 
complete understanding of the settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and 
complete understanding of the benefits of the policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering 

into the settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a terminal or chronic 
illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the 
terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.(d) The insurer 
shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life 
settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state or with a resident of this state.(e) If a life 
settlement broker or life insurance producer performs any of these activities required of the 
provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this Code section.(f) If a 
life settlement broker performs those verification of coverage activities required of the provider, 
the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of subsection (a) of Code Section 33-
59-9.(g) Within 20 days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall 
give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has become 
subject to a life settlement contract. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required 
by Code Section 33-59-10.(h) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall 
be subject to the applicable provision of state law relating to confidentiality of medical 
information if not otherwise provided in this chapter.(i) All life settlement contracts entered into 
in this state shall provide that the owner may rescind the contract on or before 15 days after the 
date it is executed by all parties thereto. Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if 
both notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, 
and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies 
during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to 
repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan 
interest to the provider.(j) Within three business days after receipt from the owner of documents 
to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement 
to an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally 
chartered financial institution pending acknowledgment of the transfer by issuer of the policy. 
The trustee or escrow agent shall be required to transfer the proceeds due to the owner within 
three business days of acknowledgment of the transfer from the insurer.(k) Failure to tender the 
life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner renders the 
contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time the proceeds are tendered 
to and accepted by the owner. A failure to give written notice of the right of rescission hereunder 
shall toll the right of rescission until 30 days after the written notice of the right of rescission has 
been given.(l) Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual, or an owner to a life settlement 
broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract 
shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the policy. Nothing 
in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit a life settlement broker from reducing such life 
settlement broker's fee below this percentage if the life settlement broker so chooses.(m) The life 
settlement broker shall disclose to the owner any thing of value paid or given to a life settlement 
broker which relates to a life settlement contract.(n) No person at any time prior to, or at the time 
of, the application for, or issuance of, a policy, or during a two-year period commencing with the 
date of issuance of the policy, shall enter into a life settlement contract regardless of the date the 
compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, 
bequest, or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition shall not apply if the owner 
certifies to the provider that: (1) The policy was issued upon the owner's exercise of conversion 
rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided that the total of the time covered 
under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least 24 months. 
The time covered under a group policy shall be calculated without regard to a change in 

insurance carriers, provided that the coverage has been continuous and under the same group 
sponsorship; or(2) The owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of 
the following conditions have been met within the two-year period: (A) The owner or insured is 
terminally or chronically ill;(B) The owner or insured disposes of his or her ownership interests 
in a closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in 
effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued;(C) The owner's spouse dies;(D) The 
owner divorces his or her spouse;(E) The owner retires from full-time employment;(F) The 
owner becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines that the disability 
prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment; or(G) A final order, judgment, or 
decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the 
owner, adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking 
reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial 
part of the owner's assets.  
Copies of the independent evidence required by paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be 
submitted to the insurer when the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of 
coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the 
copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider. Nothing in this 
Code section shall prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any 
policy. If the provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided for in 
paragraph (2) of this subsection when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the 
transfer of the policy to the provider, the copy is deemed to establish that the settlement contract 
satisfies the requirements of this subsection.

Section 33-59-12 - Determining governing law when multiple owners(a) If there is more than

contract shall be governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest 
percentage ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of 
one owner agreed upon in writing by all of the owners. The law of the state of the insured shall 
govern in the event that equal owners fail to agree in writing upon a state of residence for 
jurisdictional purposes.(b) A provider from this state who enters into a life settlement contract 
with an owner who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted regulations 
governing life settlement contracts shall be governed in the effectuation of that life settlement 
contract by the statutes and regulations of the owner's state of residence. If the state in which the 
owner is a resident has not enacted statutes or regulations governing life settlement contracts, the 
provider shall give the owner notice that neither state regulates the transaction upon which he or 
she is entering. For transactions in those states, however, the provider is to maintain all records 
required if the transactions were executed in the state of residence. The forms used in those states 
need not be approved by the Commissioner.(c) If there is a conflict in the laws that apply to an 
owner and a purchaser in any individual transaction, the laws of the state that apply to the owner 
shall take precedence and the provider shall comply with those laws.

indirectly, from the policy or owner of the policy or any other person with respect to the

that are in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest, service charges, and any 
cost or expense incurred by the lender or borrower in connection with the premium finance 
agreement or subsequent sale of such agreement; provided, further, that any payments, charges, 
fees, or other amounts in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest, service 
charges, and any cost or expense incurred by the lender or borrower in connection with the

estate if he or she is not living at the time of the determination of the overpayment;(6) With 
respect to any settlement contract or insurance policy and a life settlement broker, knowingly 
solicit an offer from, effectuate a life settlement contract with, or make a sale to any provider, 
financing entity, or related provider trust that is controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with such life settlement broker unless such relationship is disclosed to the owner in 
accordance with paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of Code Section 33-59-9;(7) With respect to any 
life settlement contract or insurance policy and a provider, knowingly enter into a life settlement 
contract with an owner, if, in connection with such life settlement contract, any thing of value

control with such provider or the financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in such 
settlement contract unless such relationship is disclosed to the owner in accordance with 
paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of Code Section 33-59-9;(8) With respect to a provider, enter into 
a life settlement contract unless the life settlement promotional, advertisement, and marketing 
materials, as may be prescribed by rule or regulation, have been filed with the Commissioner. In 
no event shall any marketing materials expressly reference that the insurance is "free" for any 
period of time. The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause an 
owner to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time shall be considered a 
violation of this chapter; or(9) With respect to any life insurance producer, insurance company, 
life settlement broker, or provider, make any statement or representation to the applicant or 
policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that

"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or life
