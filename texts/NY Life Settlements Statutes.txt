Section 7812 - Life insurance applications 
(a) Without limiting the ability of an insurer to assess the insurability of a policy applicant and to 
determine whether or not to issue the policy, and in addition to other questions an insurer may 

lawfully pose to a life insurance applicant, insurers may inquire in the application for insurance 
whether the proposed owner intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a 
lender that will use the policy as collateral to support the financing.(b) The insurer may include 
the following notice to the applicant and the insured, or other notice acceptable to the 
superintendent, on the application or as an amendment thereto: "If you enter into a loan 
arrangement where the policy is used as collateral, and the policy changes ownership at some 
point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, then the following may be true:(1) a change of 
ownership may lead to a person unknown to you owning an interest in the insured's life;(2) a 
change of ownership may limit your ability to purchase insurance in the future on the insured's 
life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life;(3) if ownership 
of the life insurance policy changes, and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage on the 
insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, and/or other 
factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage and/or may result in significantly higher 
premiums; and(4) you should consult a professional advisor, since a change in ownership in 
satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner." 
N.Y. Ins. Law § 7812 
 
Section 7813 - General rules

shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a life settlement provider, 
life settlement broker or life settlement intermediary within fifteen days after the date the 
request is received. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate 
the specific reasons why it is unable to respond. In its response, the insurer shall indicate 
whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer is pursuing or 
intends to pursue an investigation regarding the validity of the policy.(c) The life settlement 
provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued the policy within ten days after the 
life settlement contract is executed by all parties.(d) Unless the insurer is pursuing or intends to 
pursue an investigation, the insurer shall, within fifteen days of receipt of a request for a change 
of ownership or assignment used to effectuate the transfer or assignment of the owner's rights 
or benefits under a policy to a life settlement provider, process the change of ownership or 
assignment and notify the life settlement provider and the owner that the transfer or assignment 
has been effectuated.(e) If a life settlement broker performs any activity required of the life 
settlement provider in this section or provides any disclosures required by section seven 
thousand eight hundred eleven of this article, then the life settlement provider is deemed to 
have performed that activity or provided that disclosure.(f) All medical information solicited or 
obtained by any licensee or any other person shall be subject to the provisions applicable to 
health care providers under the public health law and all applicable laws relating to 
confidentiality of medical information, provided that, to the extent that this chapter provides for 
greater confidentiality of medical information, this chapter shall govern.(g)(1) Every life 
settlement contract shall provide that the owner has an unconditional right to rescind the life 

settlement contract from the time of execution of the contract until fifteen days after the receipt 
of the life settlement proceeds by the owner by giving notice of rescission to the life settlement 
provider by midnight of the fifteenth day.(2) Within five days after receipt of the notice of

settlement proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid by the life settlement 
provider.(4) If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be 
deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all life settlement proceeds and any

to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner 
shall render the life settlement contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the 
time the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner. A failure to give written notice of 
the right of rescission hereunder shall toll the right of rescission until thirty days after the written 
notice of the right of rescission has been given.(j)(1) No person, at any time prior to, or at the

with the date of issuance of the policy, shall enter into a life settlement contract, regardless of 
the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, 
sale, devise or bequest of the policy is to occur. This prohibition shall not apply if the owner

that the superintendent may determine by regulation to be an extraordinary circumstance for 
the owner or the insured.(2) Copies of the independent evidence required by subparagraph (B)

ownership of a settled policy only to a licensed life settlement provider, an accredited investor 
or qualified institutional buyer, financing entity, special purpose entity, or related provider trust; 
provided, however, a life settlement provider may sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer a 
beneficial interest in a settled policy to someone other than a life settlement provider licensed 
in this state, an accredited investor or qualified institutional buyer, financing entity, special 

purpose entity, or related provider trust if a licensed life settlement provider continues to 
administer and service the settled policy and protects the privacy of the insured and owner 
pursuant to section seven thousand eight hundred ten of this article.(p) The failure to follow the
