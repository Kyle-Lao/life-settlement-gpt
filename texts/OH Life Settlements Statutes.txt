understanding to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to 
the insurer that issued that policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy. The 
notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by division (C) of this section.(C) The 
viatical settlement provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under division 
(A)(2) of this section, a copy of the viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the 
notice required under division (B) of this section, and a request for verification of coverage to the 
insurer that issued the policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The viatical settlement 
provider shall use the NAIC's form for verification of coverage unless another form is developed 
or approved by the superintendent of insurance.(D) The insurer shall respond to a request for 
verification of coverage submitted on an approved form by a viatical settlement provider or 
viatical settlement broker within thirty calendar days after the date the request is received and 
shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer 
intends to pursue an investigation at that time regarding possible fraud or the validity of the life 

insurance policy that is the subject of the request. The insurer shall accept an original or 
facsimile or electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the 
viator.(E) Prior to or at the time of execution of the viatical settlement contract, the viatical 
settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the viator consents to the viatical 
settlement contract, represents that the viator has a full and complete understanding of the 
viatical settlement contract and a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the policy, 
and acknowledges that the viator is entering into the viatical settlement contract freely and 
voluntarily and, for persons who are terminally or chronically ill, acknowledges that the insured 
is terminally or chronically ill and that the terminal or chronic illness was diagnosed after the 
policy was issued.(F) If a viatical settlement broker performs any of the activities specified in 
this section on behalf of the viatical settlement provider, the viatical settlement provider is 
deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.(G) All medical information solicited or 
obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provisions of state law relating to 
confidentiality of medical information. 
R.C. §3916.07 
Section 3916.08 - Right to rescind contract after receipt of proceeds 
Each viatical settlement contract entered into in this state shall provide the viator with an 
unconditional right to rescind the contract for at least fifteen calendar days after the receipt of the 
viatical settlement proceeds. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical 
settlement contract is deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment of all viatical 
settlement proceeds to the viatical settlement provider. If a viatical settlement contract is 
rescinded by the viator pursuant to this section, ownership of the insurance policy or certificate 
reverts to the viator or to the viator's estate if the viator is deceased, irrespective of any transfer 
of ownership of the policy or certificate by the viator, viatical settlement provider, or any other 
person. 
R.C. §3916.08 
Section 3916.09 - Independent escrow agent(A) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct 
the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, 
assignment, or change in beneficiary directly to the escrow agent. Within three business days 
after the date the escrow agent receives the documents, or from the date the viatical settlement 
provider receives the documents if the viator erroneously provides the documents directly to the 
viatical settlement provider, the viatical settlement provider shall pay or transfer the gross 
amount to be paid by the viatical settlement provider to the escrow agent for deposit in a trust or 
escrow account set up for that purpose by the escrow agent in a regulated financial institution. 
Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow or trust account, the escrow agent or 
trustee shall deliver the original change in ownership, assignment, or change in beneficiary forms 
to the viatical settlement provider, a representative of the viatical settlement provider, or related 
provider trust. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed 
transfer of ownership, assignment, or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the 
escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator and any other person pursuant to the 
viatical settlement contract and the escrow agreement. The escrow agent shall make payment 
within three business days of the date the escrow agent received the acknowledged forms from 
the insurance company. Funds are considered sent to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent 

either releases the funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator 
via United States postal service or other nationally recognized delivery service. (B) Failure to 
transfer the proceeds to the viator within the period of time disclosed pursuant to division 
(A)(1)(f) of section 3916.06 of the Revised Code renders the viatical settlement contract voidable 
by the viator for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by 
the viator. If a viatical settlement contract is voided by the viator pursuant to this division, 
ownership of the policy reverts to the viator or to the viator's estate if the viator is deceased, 
irrespective of any transfer of ownership of the policy by the viator, viatical settlement provider, 
or any other person. 
R.C. §3916.09 
Section 3916.10 - Limiting contact with insured after settlement has occurred 
After a viatical settlement has occurred, contact with the insured for the purpose of determining 
the health status of the insured shall be made only by the viatical settlement provider, or the 
authorized representative of the viatical settlement provider. The viatical settlement provider, or 
authorized representative shall not contact the insured for the purpose of determining the 
insured's health status more than once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of 
more than one year, or more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year 
or less. The viatical settlement provider shall explain the procedure for making these contacts at 
the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into. 
The limitations set forth in this section do not apply to contacts made with an insured under a 
viaticated policy for purposes other than to determine the insured's health status. 
Viatical settlement providers are responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives, 
for the purposes of this section except viatical settlement providers are not responsible for the 
actions of subsequent purchasers of a policy. 
R.C. §3916.10 
Section 3916.11 - Records - examinations(A)(1) A licensee under this chapter shall, for five 
years, retain copies of all of the following: (a) All proposed, offered, or executed contracts, 
purchase agreements, underwriting documents, policy forms, and applications from the date of

checks, drafts, or other evidence and documentation related to the payment, transfer, deposit, or 
release of funds from the date of the transaction;(c) All other records and documents related to 
the requirements of this chapter.(2) This section does not relieve a person of the obligation to 
produce the documents described in division (A)(1) of this section to the superintendent of 
insurance after the retention period specified in that division has expired if the person has 
retained the documents.(3) Records required to be retained by this section must be legible and 
complete and may be retained in paper, photograph, microprocess, magnetic, mechanical, or 
electronic media, or by any process that accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for the 
reproduction of a record.(4) If a licensee fails to comply with division (A) of this section, the 
superintendent may initiate proceedings in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to 
revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew the license of the licensee.(B)(1) Upon determining that an 
examination should be conducted, subject to division (E) of this section, the superintendent shall 

appoint one or more examiners to perform the examination and instruct them as to the scope of 
the examination. The superintendent may employ any guidelines or procedures for purposes of 
this division that the superintendent considers appropriate.(2) Every licensee, or person from 
whom information is sought, and all officers, directors, employees, and agents of any licensee, or 
person from whom information is sought, shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and 
free access at all reasonable hours at the licensee's or person's offices to all books, records, 
accounts, papers, documents, assets, and computer or other recordings relating to the property, 
assets, business, and affairs of the licensee being examined. The officers, directors, employees, 
and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so 
far as it is in their power to do so.  
The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to 
examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the superintendent shall be 
grounds for suspension, revocation, denial of issuance, or nonrenewal of any license held by the 
licensee to engage in the business of viatical settlements or other business subject to the 
superintendent's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, denial, or refusal to 
renew any license or authority are subject to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. 
(3) The superintendent has the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine 
under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal 
of a person to obey a subpoena, the superintendent may petition a court of competent 
jurisdiction, and, upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to 
appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be 
punishable as contempt of court.(4) When making an examination under this chapter, the 
superintendent may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified 
public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners, and the licensee that is 
the subject of the examination shall bear the cost of those examiners pursuant to division (F) of 
this section. Examiners who are appointed by the superintendent, but who are not employees of 
the department of insurance, shall be compensated for their work, travel, and living expenses at 
reasonable and customary rates.(5) Nothing contained in this chapter limits the superintendent's 
authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory 
action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made 
pursuant to any examination shall be prima-facie evidence in any legal or regulatory 
action.(6) Nothing contained in this chapter limits the superintendent's authority to use and, if 
appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or 
licensee working papers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed 
during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action that the 
superintendent, in the superintendent's sole discretion, considers appropriate.(C)(1) Examination 
reports shall be comprised of only facts appearing upon the books, records, or other documents 
of the licensee, its agents, or other persons examined, or as ascertained from the testimony of its 
officers, agents, or other persons examined concerning its affairs, and the conclusions and 
recommendations that the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.(2) Upon 
completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the superintendent a 
verified written report of examination. Upon receipt of the verified report, the superintendent 
shall transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a notice that shall afford the 
licensee examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty days from receipt of the 
report to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the 

examination report.(3) If the superintendent determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a 
result of an examination, the superintendent may initiate any proceedings or actions provided by 
law.(D)(1) Names and individual identification data for all viators shall be considered private 
and confidential information and shall not be disclosed by the superintendent, unless required by 
law.(2) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in the law of another state or jurisdiction 
that is substantially similar to this chapter, all examination reports, working papers, recorded 
information, documents, and copies of those reports, papers, information, documents, and copies 
produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the superintendent or to any other person in the course

superintendent's official duties.(3) Documents, materials, or other information, including, but not 
limited to, all working papers, and copies of working papers, in the possession or control of the 
NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries are confidential by law and privileged, are not subject to 
subpoena, and are not subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action, if 
either of the following applies: (a) They are created, produced, or obtained by or disclosed to the 
NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries in the course of assisting an examination made under this

subsidiaries under division (D)(5) of this section or under a comparable provision in the law of 
the other state.(4) Neither the superintendent nor any person that received the documents, 
material, or other information while acting under the authority of the superintendent, including

that is the source of the document, material, or information.(6) No waiver of any applicable 
privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials, or information shall occur as a 
result of disclosure to the superintendent under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized 

in division (D)(5) of this section.(7) A privilege established under the law of any state or 
jurisdiction that is substantially similar to the privilege established under division (D) of this 
section shall be available and enforced in any proceeding in, and in any court of, this

agency of the federal government at any time, or to the NAIC, if the agency or office receiving 
the report or matters relating to it agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner 
consistent with this chapter.(E)(1) The superintendent may not appoint an examiner if the 
examiner, either directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the 
management of, or owns a pecuniary interest in, any person subject to examination under this 
chapter. This division does not automatically preclude any of the following from being an 
examiner:(a) A viator;(b) An insured in a viaticated policy;(c) A beneficiary in a policy that is 
proposed to be viaticated.(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of division (E) of this section, the 
superintendent may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified 
public accountants, or other similar individuals who are independently practicing their 
professions, even though these persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained 
by persons subject to examination under this chapter.(F)(1) As used in division (F) of this

described in division (F)(1), (2), or (3) of this section that are necessarily incurred in the 
performance of a market conduct examination, including the expenses of direct overhead and 
support staff for examiners.(2) When a market conduct examination is made of a licensee under 
this chapter, the licensee shall pay the expenses of the examination. The expenses of an 
examination include those incurred on or after the date on which the superintendent notifies the

conduct performed in good faith while carrying out the provisions of this chapter.(2) No cause of 
action shall arise nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of 
communicating or delivering information or data to the superintendent, any authorized 
representative of the superintendent, or any examiner appointed by the superintendent pursuant 
to an examination made under this chapter, if the act of communication or delivery was 
performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive. This division does 
not abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or immunity 
previously enjoyed by any person identified in division (G)(1) of this section.(3) A person 
identified in division (G)(1) or (2) of this section shall be entitled to an award of attorney's fees 
and costs if the person is the prevailing party in a civil action for libel, slander, or any other 
relevant tort arising out of activities in carrying out the provisions of this chapter and the party 
bringing the action was not substantially justified in bringing the action. For purposes of this 
division, an action is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time 

that it was initiated.(H) The superintendent may investigate suspected fraudulent viatical 
settlement acts and persons engaged in the business of viatical settlements.

executive officer and chief financial officer as to the accuracy and fair presentation;(b) Include 
disclosures either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes sufficient 
so as to make the interim information not misleading.(2) Viatical settlement providers may 
assume that the users of the interim financial statements have access to the prior fiscal year-end 
audited financial statements and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair 
presentation, except in regard to material contingencies, may be determined in that context. A 
footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited 
financial statements for the preceding fiscal year may be omitted. A footnote disclosure shall be 
provided if events subsequent to the fiscal year end have a material impact on the viatical 
settlement provider.(D) A viatical settlement provider that willfully fails to file the annual

time prior to issuance of the policy or during the two years after the date of issuance of the 
policy.(c) If requested by the insurer, the viator both disclosed to the insurer whether a person 
other than the insurer obtained a life expectancy evaluation for settlement purposes in connection 
with the application, underwriting, and issuance of the policy and provided a copy of any such 
life expectancy evaluation to the insurer at the time of application.(d) The viator disclosed any 
financial arrangement, trust, or other arrangement, transaction, or device that conceals the 
ownership or beneficial interest of the policy to the insurer prior to the issuance of the 
policy.(C) Copies of the independent evidence described in division (B)(3) of this section and 
documents required by section 3916.07 of the Revised Code shall be submitted to the insurer 
when the viatical settlement provider or any other party entering into a viatical settlement 
contract with a viator submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies 
shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the viatical settlement provider that the 
copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the viatical settlement 
provider.(D) If the viatical settlement provider submits to the insurer a copy of the owner or 
insured's certification and independent evidence described in division (B)(3) of this section when 

the viatical settlement provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy 
or certificate to the viatical settlement provider, the copy conclusively establishes that the viatical 
settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section, and the insurer shall timely respond 
to the request.(E) No insurer, as a condition of responding to a request for verification of 
coverage or effecting the transfer of a policy pursuant to a viatical settlement contract, may 
require the viator, insured, viatical settlement provider, or viatical settlement broker to sign any 
form, disclosure, consent, or waiver form that has not been approved by the superintendent of 
insurance for use in connection with viatical settlement contracts.(F) Upon receipt of a properly 
completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy, the insurer shall respond in 
writing within thirty calendar days to confirm that the insurer has made the change or specify 
reasons that the change cannot be processed. No insurer shall unreasonably delay effecting 
change in ownership or beneficiary or seek to interfere with any viatical settlement contract 
lawfully entered into in this state.(G) A viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker 
that is party to a plan, transaction, or series of transactions to originate, renew, continue, or 
finance a policy with the insurer for the purpose of engaging in the business of viatical 
settlements at any time prior to or during the first five years after the insurer issues the policy 
shall fully disclose the plan, transaction, or series of transactions to the superintendent of 
insurance. 
R.C. §3916.16 
Section 3916.17 - Advertising of viatical settlement contracts(A) The general assembly hereby 
declares that the purpose of this section is to provide prospective viators with clear and 
unambiguous statements in the advertisement of viatical settlements and to assure the clear, 
truthful, and adequate disclosure of the benefits, risks, limitations, and exclusions of any viatical 
settlement contract. This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of 
guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical 
settlements to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, 
deceptive, or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of 
viatical settlements through the advertising media and material used by licensees.  
Divisions (B) to (P) of this section apply to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts, or 
any related products or services intended for dissemination in this state, including, but not 
limited to, internet advertising viewed by persons located in this state. In cases in which 
disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be 
interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible. 
(B) Every licensee shall establish and at all times shall maintain a system of control over the 
content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of its contracts, products, and 
services. All advertisements, regardless of by whom they are written, created, designed, or 
presented, shall be the responsibility of the licensee and of the person that created or presented 
the advertisement. A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at least once a 
year, to agents and others authorized by the licensee who disseminate advertisements of the 
requirements for compliance under this section prior to the use of any advertisements not 
furnished by the licensee.(C) All advertisements that are subject to this section shall be truthful 
and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a 
viatical settlement contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception and 
shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. The determination of whether an 

advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be made by the 
superintendent, from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected 
to create upon a person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to 
which it is directed.(D) Viatical settlement advertisements containing any representation set forth 
in this division are deemed false and misleading on their face and are prohibited. False and 
misleading viatical settlement advertisements include, but are not limited to, those including any 
of the following representations: (1) "Guaranteed," "fully secured," "100 percent secured," "fully 
insured," "secure," "safe," "backed by rated insurance companies," "backed by federal law," 
"backed by state law," or "state guaranty funds," or similar representations;(2) "No risk," 
"minimal risk," "low risk," "no speculation," "no fluctuation," or similar 
representations;(3) "Qualified or approved for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, 
401(k) plans, simplified employee pensions (SEPs), 403(b), Keogh plans, TSA, or other 
retirement account rollovers," "tax deferred," or similar representations;(4) Utilization of the 
word "guaranteed" to describe the fixed return, annual return, principal, earnings, profits, 
investment, or similar representations;(5) "No sales charges or fees" or similar 
representations;(6) "High yield," "superior return," "excellent return," "high return," "quick 
profit," or similar representations;(7) Purported favorable representations or testimonials about 
the benefits of viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase agreements as an 
investment, taken out of context from any newspaper, trade paper, journal, radio or television 
program, or any other form of print and electronic media.(E)(1) The information required to be 
disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an 
ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or 
misleading.  
An advertisement shall not omit material information or use any words, phrases, statements, 
references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect of 
misleading or deceiving viators, as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium 
payable, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract offered 
is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, that an offer is made to 
refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied, or that the viatical settlement contract includes a 
"free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy any misleading 
statements. 
(2) An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a policy 
unless the advertisement has been approved by that company.(3) An advertisement shall not 
represent that any premium payments will not be required to be paid on the policy that is the 
subject of a viatical settlement contract in order to maintain that policy, unless that is the 
fact.(4) An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death 
benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper 
practice.(5) The words "free," "no cost," "without cost," "no additional cost," "at no extra cost," 
or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any policy or to any benefit or 
service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may 
state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate 
language.(6)(a) Testimonials, appraisals, analyses, or endorsements used in advertisements must 
satisfy all of the following: (i) They must be genuine.(ii) They must represent the current opinion 
of the author.(iii) They must be applicable to the viatical settlement contract product or service 
advertised, if any.(iv) They must be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid 

misleading or deceiving prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, 
appraisals, analyses, or endorsements.(b) In using testimonials, appraisals, analyses, or 
endorsements, the licensee makes as its own all the statements contained in the testimonials, 
appraisals, analyses, or endorsements, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this 
section.(c) If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement has a 
financial interest in the subject of that testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement directly or 
indirectly as a shareholder, director, officer, employee, or otherwise, or receives any benefit 
directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently 
disclosed in the advertisement.(d) An advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical 
settlement contract benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, 
society, association, or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship 
between the group of individuals, society, association, or organization and the viatical settlement 
provider is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled, 
or managed by the viatical settlement provider, or receives any payment or other consideration 
from the viatical settlement provider for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be 
disclosed in the advertisement.(e) When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a 
viatical settlement contract, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of at least five 
years after its use.(F) An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless the 
information accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an 
advertisement shall be identified.(G) An advertisement shall not disparage any insurer, viatical 
settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, insurance producer, policy, service, or method of 
marketing.(H) All advertisements about a viatical settlement provider or its viatical settlement 
contract, products, or services shall clearly identify the viatical settlement provider's name. If any 
specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical settlement contract shall be 
identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is part 
of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be shown on the 
application.(I) An advertisement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the 
parent company of a licensee, name of a particular division of the licensee, service mark, slogan, 
symbol, or other device or reference without disclosing the name of the licensee, if either of the 
following applies regarding the advertisement: (1) It would have the capacity or tendency to 
mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the licensee.(2) It would have the capacity or 
tendency to create the impression that a company other than the licensee would have any 
responsibility for the financial obligation under a contract.(J) An advertisement shall not use any 
combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that, by their content, phraseology, shape, 
color, or other characteristics, are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical 
materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature 
that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner 
connected with a government program or agency.(K) An advertisement may state that a licensee 
is licensed in the state in which the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that 
fact or suggest or imply that competitors may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the 
audience to consult the licensee's web site or contact the department of insurance to find out if 
the state in which the advertisement appears requires licensing and, if it does, whether the person 
is licensed.(L) An advertisement shall not create the impression that the viatical settlement 
provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims, or the merits, desirability, or 
advisability of its viatical settlement contracts are recommended or endorsed by any government 
entity.(M) All advertisements of an actual licensee shall state the name of the actual licensee. An 

advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or 
controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that 
would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual 
licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any 
responsibility for the financial obligation of the licensee.(N) An advertisement shall not directly 
or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of this state, any other state, or the 
United States government endorses, approves, or favors any of the following: (1) Any licensee or 
its business practices or methods of operation;(2) The merits, desirability, or advisability of any 
viatical settlement contract;(3) Any viatical settlement contract;(4) Any policy or life insurance 
company.(O) If the advertiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will occur, the 
advertising must disclose the average time frame, from completed application to the date of offer 
and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator.(P) If the advertising 
emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the average 
purchase price as a per cent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during 
the past six months.

Section 3916.18 - Prohibiting fraudulent acts(A)(1) No person shall knowingly or intentionally 
interfere with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or investigations of suspected or 
actual violations of this chapter.(2) No person in the business of viatical settlements shall 
knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or

contract and each application for a viatical settlement, regardless of the form of transmission, 
shall contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement:  
"Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or viatical 
settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and imprisonment." 
(2) The lack of a statement as required in division (B)(1) of this section does not constitute a 
defense in any prosecution for a fraudulent viatical settlement act.(C)(1) Every person engaged 
in the business of viatical settlements having knowledge or a reasonable belief that a fraudulent 
viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has been committed shall provide to the 
superintendent of insurance the information required by the superintendent. The person shall 
provide the information in a manner prescribed by the superintendent.(2) Every person having 
knowledge or a reason to believe that a fraudulent viatical settlement act is being, will be, or has 
been committed may provide to the superintendent the information required by the 
superintendent. The person shall provide the information under this division in a manner 
prescribed by the superintendent.(3) Any life insurer that has a good faith belief that a person is 
participating or has participated in a stranger-originated life insurance transaction shall report the 
person to the superintendent in a form and manner prescribed by the superintendent. Upon 
receipt of the insurer's report, the superintendant shall conduct an investigation to determine 

whether there is probable cause, based on the totality of the facts and circumstances that the 
person has or had engaged in a stranger-originated life insurance transaction. If the 
superintendent finds probable cause, the superintendent shall do one of the following: (a) If the 
person is licensed or regulated by the department of insurance, the superintendent shall provide 
the person an opportunity for notice and hearing pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If 
the person waives or does not request a hearing pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, or 
a hearing is held and the person is found to have participated in one or more stranger-originated 
life insurance transactions, the superintendent shall publish the order on the department's web 
site, and shall notify each insurance company licensed in this state that the person has been 
adjudicated as having participated in one or more stranger-originated life insurance 
transactions.(b) If the person is not licensed or regulated by the department the superintendent 
shall provide the superintendent's findings to the appropriate licensing or regulatory 
authority.(D)(1) No civil liability shall be imposed on, and no cause of action shall arise from, a 
person's furnishing information concerning suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent

insurance, viatical settlements, securities, or investment fraud;(e) The life insurer that issued the 
policy covering the life of the insured.(2) The immunity provided in division (D)(1) of this 
section shall not apply to any statement made with actual malice. In an action brought against a 
person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent viatical 
settlement act, the party bringing the action shall plead specifically any allegation that the 
immunity provided in division (D)(1) of this section does not apply because the person filing the 
report or furnishing the information did so with actual malice.(3) If a person is the prevailing 
party in a civil action for libel, slander, or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in 
carrying out the provisions of this chapter, if the prevailing party is a person identified in 
division (D)(1) of this section and the immunity described in that division applies to the person, 
and if the party who brought the action was not substantially justified in doing so, the person 
who is the prevailing party is entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs arising out of the 
action. However, the person is not entitled to an award of attorney's fees if the person provided 
information about the person's own fraudulent viatical settlement acts. For purposes of this 
division, an action is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time 
that it was initiated.(4) This section does not abrogate or modify any common law or statutory 
privilege or immunity enjoyed by a person described in division (D)(1) of this section.(E)(1) The 
documents and evidence provided pursuant to division (D) of this section or obtained by the 
superintendent in an investigation of any suspected or actual fraudulent viatical settlement act is 
privileged and confidential, is not a public record open for inspection under section 149.43 of the 
Revised Code, and is not subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or criminal 
action.(2) Division (E)(1) of this section does not prohibit release by the superintendent of any 
document or evidence obtained in an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent viatical 

settlement acts, in any of the following manners or circumstances: (a) In any administrative or 
judicial proceeding to enforce any laws administered by the superintendent;(b) To any law 
enforcement or regulatory agency of this state, another state, the United States, or a political 
subdivision of this state or another state, to an organization established for the purpose of 
detecting and preventing fraudulent viatical settlement acts, or to the NAIC;(c) At the discretion 
of the superintendent, to a person in the business of viatical settlements that is aggrieved by a 
fraudulent viatical settlement act.(3) Release of documents and evidence under division (E)(2) of 
this section does not abrogate or modify the privilege granted in division (E)(1) of this 
section.(F) The provisions of this chapter do not do any of the following:(1) Preempt the 
authority or relieve the duty of any other law enforcement or regulatory agencies to investigate, 
examine, or prosecute suspected violations of law;(2) Prevent or prohibit a person from 
disclosing voluntarily any information concerning fraudulent viatical settlement acts to a law 
enforcement or regulatory agency other than the department of insurance;(3) Limit any power 
granted elsewhere by the law of this state to the superintendent or an insurance fraud unit to 
investigate and examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action against 
wrongdoers.(G)(1) Viatical settlement providers and viatical settlement brokers shall adopt and 
have in place antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute, and prevent 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts. At the discretion of the superintendent, the superintendent 
may order, or a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker may request and the 
superintendent may grant, any modifications of the following required initiatives described in 
divisions (G)(1)(a) and (b) of this section that are necessary to ensure an effective antifraud 
program. The modifications may be more or less restrictive than the required initiatives so long 
as the modifications may reasonably be expected to accomplish the purpose of this section. 
Antifraud initiatives under this division shall include all of the following:(a) Fraud investigators, 
who may be licensed viatical settlement provider or licensed viatical settlement broker 
employees or independent contractors;(b) An antifraud plan that includes, but is not limited to, 
all of the following:(i) A description of the procedures for detecting and investigating possible 
fraudulent viatical settlement acts and procedures for resolving material inconsistencies between 
medical records and insurance applications;(ii) A description of the procedures for reporting 
possible fraudulent viatical settlement acts to the superintendent;(iii) A description of the plan 
for antifraud education and training of underwriters and other personnel;(iv) A description or 
chart outlining the organizational arrangement of the antifraud personnel who are responsible for 
the investigation and reporting of possible fraudulent viatical settlement acts and investigating 
unresolved material inconsistencies between medical records and insurance applications;(v) A 
description of the procedures used to perform initial and continuing review of the accuracy of 
life expectancies used in connection with a viatical settlement contract.(2) The superintendent, 
by rule adopted in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, may require that antifraud 
plans required under division (G)(1) of this section be submitted to the superintendent. If the 
superintendent requires that antifraud plans be submitted to the superintendent, the plans so 
submitted are privileged and confidential, are not a public record open for inspection under 
section 149.43 of the Revised Code, and are not subject to discovery or subpoena in a civil or 
criminal action.(H) No insurer that issued a policy being viaticated shall be responsible, under 
this chapter, for any act or omission of a viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider 
arising out of or in connection with the viatical settlement transaction unless the insurer receives 
compensation for the placement of a viatical settlement contract from the viatical settlement 
provider or viatical settlement broker in connection with the viatical settlement contract.

contained in this chapter, if any person violates any provision of this chapter or any rule or 
regulation implementing any provision of this chapter, the superintendent of insurance may seek 
an injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction and may apply for any temporary or permanent 
order that the superintendent determines is necessary to restrain the person from committing the 
violation.(B) Any person damaged by any act of a person in violation of any provision of this 
chapter may bring a civil action against the person committing the violation in a court of 
competent jurisdiction. A civil action brought under this division does not preclude the 
superintendent from exercising any regulatory, enforcement, or other authority available to the 
superintendent under this chapter.(C) In addition to the penalties and other enforcement 
provisions contained in this chapter, any person who violates any provision of this chapter is 
subject to a civil penalty of up to ten thousand dollars per violation. Imposition of civil penalties

Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. The superintendent's order may require a person found to be 
in violation of this chapter to make restitution to persons aggrieved by violations of this
