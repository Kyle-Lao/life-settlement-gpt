ORS 744.364(3). Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the 
rescission is given, and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest 
paid on account of the life settlement within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the 
rescission period, the life settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to 
repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all life settlement proceeds and any premiums, 
loans and loan interest of the life settlement within 60 days of the insured's death.(g) Funds will 
be sent to the owner within three business days after the life settlement provider has received the 
insurer or group administrator's written acknowledgment that ownership of the policy or interest 

in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated.(h) Entering into a 
life settlement contract may prevent the owner from qualifying for new life insurance coverage 
in the future and may cause other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of 
premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate, to be forfeited by the owner. 
Assistance should be sought from a financial adviser.(i) The following language: "All medical, 
financial or personal information solicited or obtained by a life settlement provider or life 
settlement broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or the identity of family 
members, a spouse or a significant other may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life 
settlement between the owner and the life settlement provider. If you are asked to provide this 
information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure. The information may be provided to 
someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase. You may be asked to renew 
your permission to share information every two years."(j) Following execution of a life contract, 
the insured may be contacted for the purpose of determining the insured's health status and to 
confirm the insured's residential or business street address and telephone number, or as otherwise 
provided in ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992. This contact is limited to once every 
three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once 
per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less. All such contacts shall be made 
only by a life settlement provider licensed in the state in which the owner resided at the time of 
the life settlement, or by the authorized representative of a duly licensed life settlement 
provider.(2) Prior to or concurrently with the disclosures required under subsection (1) of this 
section, the owner shall be given a brochure describing the process of life settlements. The 
Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall develop and approve a 
form for the brochure.(3) A life settlement provider shall provide the owner with at least the 
following disclosures no later than the date the life settlement contract is signed by all parties.

information about the possible loss of coverage on the other lives under the policy and the need 
to consult with the owner's insurance producer or the insurer issuing the policy for advice on the 
proposed life settlement;(e) The dollar amount of the current death benefit payable to the life 
settlement provider under the policy or certificate. If known, disclosure of the availability of any 
additional guaranteed insurance benefits, the dollar amount of any accidental death and 
dismemberment benefits under the policy or certificate and the extent to which the owner's 
interest in those benefits will be transferred as a result of the life settlement contract;(f) If the

compensation.(4) If the life settlement provider transfers ownership or changes the beneficiary of 
the insurance policy, the provider shall communicate in writing the change in ownership or 
beneficiary to the insured within 20 days after the change.(5) A life settlement provider or its life 
settlement investment agent shall provide the life settlement purchaser with at least the following 
disclosures prior to the date the life settlement purchase agreement is signed by all parties. The 
disclosures must be conspicuously displayed in any life purchase contract or in a separate

investment agent, and must make the following disclosures to the life settlement 
purchaser:(a) The purchaser shall receive no returns, such as dividends and interest, until the 
insured dies and a death claim payment is made.(b) The actual annual rate of return on a life 
settlement contract is dependent upon an accurate projection of the insured's life expectancy and 
the actual date of the insured's death. An annual guaranteed rate of return is not 
determinable.(c) The settled life insurance contract should not be considered a liquid purchase 
since it is impossible to predict the exact timing of its maturity and the funds probably are not

these products by the purchaser.(d) The purchaser may lose all benefits or may receive 
substantially reduced benefits if the insurer goes out of business during the term of the life 
investment.(e) The purchaser is responsible for payment of the insurance premium or other costs

responsible for the payment of the additional premiums.(C) If a group policy is terminated and

risks associated with policy contestability, including but not limited to the risk that the purchaser 
will have no claim or only a partial claim to death benefits should the insurer rescind the policy 
within the contestability period.(l) Whether the purchaser will be the owner of the policy in 
addition to being the beneficiary and if the purchaser is the beneficiary only and not also the 
owner, the special risks associated with that status, including but not limited to the risk that the 
beneficiary may be changed or the premium may not be paid.(m) The experience and 
qualifications of the person who determines the life expectancy of the insured, the information 
this projection is based on and the relationship of the projection maker to the life settlement 
provider, if any.(6) Disclosure to a life settlement purchaser shall include distribution of a 
brochure describing the process of investment in life settlements, in a form to be developed and 

approved by the director.(7) A life settlement provider or its life settlement investment agent 
shall provide the life settlement purchaser with at least the following disclosures no later than at 
the time of the assignment, transfer or sale of all or a portion of an insurance policy. The

premiums.(d) The type of policy offered or sold, such as whole life, term life, universal life or a 
group policy certificate, any additional benefits contained in the policy and the current status of 
the policy.(e) If the policy is term insurance, the special risks associated with term insurance, 
including but not limited to the purchaser's responsibility for additional premiums if the owner 
continues the term policy at the end of the current term.(f) If the policy is contestable.(g) If the 
insurer that wrote the policy has any additional rights that could negatively affect or extinguish 
the purchaser's rights under the life settlement contract, what these rights are and under what 
conditions these rights are activated.(h) The name and address of the person responsible for 
monitoring the insured's condition. A description of how often the monitoring of the insured's 
condition is done, how the date of death is determined and how and when this information is 
transmitted to the purchaser.(8) The life settlement purchase agreement is voidable by the

the responsibility of the licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the 
advertisement. A system of control must include regular routine notification, at least once a year, 
to agents and others authorized by the licensee who disseminate advertisements, of the 
requirements of this section and the requirements adopted by the Director of the Department of 
Consumer and Business Services in the use of any advertisements not furnished by the 
licensee.(3) Advertisements must be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The 
form and content of an advertisement of a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase 
agreement must be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It may not have the 
capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.(4) An advertisement may not use the name or title of 
a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the named company or policy-holder 
consents to the usage in a form prescribed by the director.(5) An advertisement may not 
represent that premium payments will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that 
is the subject of a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement in order to 
maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.(6) An advertisement may not state or imply that a life 
settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement, benefit or service has been approved 
or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the 
fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the licensee is disclosed. If the 
entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled or managed by the licensee, or 
receives any payment or other consideration from the licensee for making an endorsement or 
testimonial, that fact must be disclosed in the advertisement.(7) When an endorsement refers to 
benefits received under a life settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement, all 
pertinent information must be retained for a period of five years after its use.(8) An 
advertisement may not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and 
relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement must be identified.(9) An 
advertisement may not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of 
this state or of the United States government endorses, approves or favors:(a) Any licensee or its 

business practices or methods of operation;(b) The merits, desirability or advisability of any life 
settlement contract or life settlement purchase agreement;(c) Any life settlement contract or life 
settlement purchase agreement; or(d) Any life insurance policy or life insurance 
company.(10) The director may adopt rules to implement this section.

Section 744.374 - Enforcement of life settlement contract provisions; reporting of violations; 
required antifraud initiatives(1) A person may not knowingly or intentionally interfere with the 
enforcement of the provisions of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992 or 
investigations of suspected or actual violations of 
ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992.(2) A person in the business of life settlements 
may not knowingly or intentionally permit any person convicted of a felony involving dishonesty 
or breach of trust to participate in the business of life settlements.(3) Life settlements contracts 
and purchase agreement forms and applications for life settlements, regardless of the form of 
transmission, must contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement: "Any 
person who knowingly presents false information in this application is guilty of a crime and may 
be subject to fines and confinement in prison."(4) The lack of a statement as required in 
subsection (3) of this section does not constitute a defense in any investigation or prosecution for 
an act violating any provision of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992.(5) Any person 
engaged in the business of life settlements having knowledge or a reasonable suspicion that a 
fraudulent life settlement act is being, will be or has been committed must provide to the 
Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services information as required by, and 
in a manner prescribed by, the director.(6) Any other person having knowledge or a reasonable 
belief that a fraudulent life settlement act is being, will be or has been committed may provide to 
the director the information required by, and in a manner prescribed by, the director.(7)(a) No 
civil liability is imposed on and no cause of action arises from a person's furnishing information 
concerning suspected, anticipated or completed fraudulent life settlement acts or suspected or 
completed fraudulent insurance acts, if the information is provided to or received from:(A) The 
director or the director's employees, agents or representatives;(B) Federal, state or local law 
enforcement or regulatory officials or their employees, agents or representatives;(C) A person 
involved in the prevention and detection of fraudulent life settlement acts or that person's agents, 
employees or representatives;(D) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or the North American Securities Administrators 
Association, or their employees, agents or representatives, or any other regulatory body 
overseeing life insurance, life settlements, securities or investment fraud; or(E) The life insurer 
that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured.(b) Paragraph (a) of this 
subsection shall not apply to statements made with actual malice. In an action brought against a 
person for filing a report or furnishing other information concerning a fraudulent life settlement 
act, the party bringing the action must plead specifically any allegation that paragraph (a) of this 
subsection does not apply because the person filing the report or furnishing the information did 
so with actual malice.(c) A person furnishing information as identified in paragraph (a) of this 
subsection is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs if the person is the prevailing party in 
a civil cause of action for libel, slander or any other relevant tort arising out of activities in 
carrying out the provisions of ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992 and the party 
bringing the action was not substantially justified in doing so. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
proceeding is "substantially justified" if it had a reasonable basis in law or fact at the time that it 

was initiated. However, such an award does not apply to a person furnishing information 
concerning the person's own fraudulent life settlement acts.(d) This section does not abrogate or 
modify common law or statutory privileges or immunities enjoyed by a person described in 
paragraph (a) of this subsection.(8) The documents and evidence obtained by the director in an 
investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent life settlement acts are privileged and confidential 
under ORS 705.137.(9) This section does not:(a) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of 
other law enforcement or regulatory agencies to investigate, examine and prosecute suspected 
violations of law;(b) Prevent or prohibit a person from disclosing voluntarily information 
concerning life settlement fraud to a law enforcement or regulatory agency other than the 
Department of Consumer and Business Services; or(c) Limit the powers granted elsewhere by 
the laws of this state to the director or any other state department or agency to investigate and 
examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action against 
wrongdoers.(10)(a) Life settlement providers and life settlement brokers must have in place 
antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect, prosecute and prevent fraudulent life 
settlement acts. At the discretion of the director, the director may order, or a licensee may 
request and the director may grant, such modifications of the required initiatives described in 
paragraph (b) of this subsection as necessary to ensure an effective antifraud program. The 
modifications may be more or less restrictive than the required initiatives as long as the 
modifications may reasonably be expected to accomplish the purpose of this 
section.(b) Antifraud initiatives must include:(A) Fraud investigators, who may be life settlement 
provider or life settlement broker employees or independent contractors; and(B) An antifraud 
plan, which must be submitted to the director. The antifraud plan must include, but is not limited 
to:(i) A description of the procedures for detecting and investigating possible fraudulent life 
settlement acts and procedures for resolving material inconsistencies between medical records 
and insurance applications;(ii) A description of the procedures for reporting possible fraudulent 
life settlement acts to the director;(iii) A description of the plan for antifraud education and 
training of underwriters and other personnel; and(iv) A description or chart outlining the 
organizational arrangement of the antifraud personnel who are responsible for investigating and 
reporting possible fraudulent life settlement acts and investigating unresolved material 
inconsistencies between medical records and insurance applications.(c) Antifraud plans

Section 744.382 - Prohibitions on finder's fee, solicitations, discrimination(1) A licensee may not 
pay or offer to pay a finder's fee, commission or other compensation to a person described in this 
subsection, in connection with a policy insuring the life of an individual with a terminal illness or 
condition. The prohibition under this subsection applies with respect to payments or offers of 
payment to:(a) The physician, naturopathic physician, attorney or accountant of the policyholder, 
of the certificate holder or of the insured individual when the individual is other than the 
policyholder or certificate holder.(b) Any person other than a physician, naturopathic physician,

or financial planning services to the policyholder, to the certificate holder or to the insured 
individual when the individual is other than the policyholder or certificate holder.(c) Any person 
other than one described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection who acts as an agent of the 
policyholder, certificate holder or insured individual.(2) A licensee may not solicit an investor 
who could influence the treatment of the illness or condition of the individual whose life would 

be the subject of a life settlement contract.(3) All information solicited or obtained from a 
policyholder or certificate holder by a licensee is subject to ORS 746.600 to 746.690. For 
purposes of this subsection, a licensee is considered an insurance-support organization within the 
meaning of ORS 746.600.(4) A licensee may not discriminate in the making of a life settlement 
contract on the basis of race, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national 
origin, marital status, age, familial status or occupation or discriminate between persons who 
have dependents and persons who do not have dependents. 
ORS 744.382 
Section 744.384 - Rules; standards 
The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adopt rules 
for the purpose of carrying out ORS 744.318 to 744.384, 744.991 and 744.992. In 
addition: 
(1) The director may establish standards for evaluating reasonableness of payments under life 
settlement contracts for persons who are terminally ill or chronically ill. The authority includes 
but is not limited to regulation of discount rates used to determine the amount paid in exchange 
for assignment, transfer, sale, devise or bequest of a benefit under a life insurance policy insuring 
the life of a person who is terminally ill or chronically ill. For the purpose of the standards, the

Association of Insurance Commissioners.(2) The director may establish trade practice standards 
by rule for the purpose of regulating advertising and solicitation of life settlement 
contracts.(3) The director may adopt rules governing the relationship and responsibilities of both 
insurers and life settlement providers, life settlement brokers and life settlement investment

implications and effect on life insurance capacity of a life settlement.(5) The director may adopt 
rules governing the confidentiality of an insured's personal financial or medical information 
provided to a life settlement broker, life settlement provider or life settlement investment agent.
