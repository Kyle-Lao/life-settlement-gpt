would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract or 
viatical settlement purchase agreement.6. A provider may not use any terminology, logo, or

practices of the provider, agents for the provider, or the merits of any viatical settlement 
contract.7. Each viatical settlement provider shall file with the Commissioner with its annual

APPENDIX A 
Selling Your Life Insurance Policy 
Today it is possible for you to sell your life insurance policy to someone else (a viatical 
settlement provider) for an immediate cash payment. This financial arrangement, known as a 
viatical settlement, is best suited for people who are living with an immediate life-threatening 
illness and facing tough financial choices. A viatical settlement may also be beneficial for 
individuals who do not have a terminal or chronic illness, but wish to sell the policy for other 
reasons including, changed needs of dependents, wanting to reduce premiums, and cash for 
meeting expenses. 
It may not always be in your best interest to sell you life insurance policy. Before you take 
action, you want to be sure you understand: 
What future benefits you may lose What other options may be available 
Selling you life insurance policy is a complex financial arrangement. This guide will help you 
make an informed decision. 
We recommend that you: 
A. Evaluate your needsB. Check all your optionsC. Understand how the process worksD. Know 
your rightsE. Check with the Mississippi Insurance Department 
Step 1. Evaluate your needs 

Before you sell your policy and give up valuable insurance protection, think about whether your 
need for life insurance has changed since you bought the policy. If it hasn't, selling you policy 
may not be the right choice. If you sell your policy now, your beneficiaries will not be paid a 
benefit at your death. 
If you sell your policy now, remember premiums go up a lot as you grow older. You may not 
want to pay the higher cost to replace your coverage later. 
Step 2. Check all of your options 
Your may be able to get the cash you need now without selling your policy: 
A. Policy Cash Values 
Contact your current life insurance agent or company to see if you have any cash value in your 
policy. Ask if you can: 
borrow from the cash value and still keep the insurance in force, cancel the policy for its current 
cash value, use the cash value as collateral to get a loan from a financial institution. 
Your insurance company must tell you about your options if you ask. 
B. Accelerated Death Benefits 
Find out if your policy has an "accelerated death benefit." It may be your best option. 
Many life insurance policies do have an accelerated death benefit. With that benefit, policy 
holders who are terminally ill, affected with certain diseases or permanently confined in a 
nursing home can access 50% or more of a policy's death benefit while still living. An 
accelerated death benefit could pay you a large part of your policy's death benefit and you could 
keep your policy. 
A very important feature of the accelerated benefit is that when the policy holder dies, the 
beneficiaries get the remaining death benefit. This means that eventually 100% of the policy 
benefits will be paid out either to the insured or the beneficiary. 
C. Other Considerations 
Think about what it will mean if you do sell your policy. Check out the tax implications. Not all 
proceeds from a viatical settlement are tax-free. 
Find out if creditors could claim any of the money you would get from a viatical settlement. 
Find out if you will lose any public assistance benefits such as Medicaid or other government 
benefits if you accept a cash settlement for your life insurance. 
D. Comparison Shop 
To learn the market value of your policy, it's a good idea to contact three to five viatical 
settlement providers. Or you could use a viatical settlement broker who would contact several 

viatical settlement providers for you. Your financial advisor can help you decide whether to 
work with a viatical settlement provider or through a viatical settlement broker. 
E. Summary 
Everyone's financial situation is different. A viatical settlement may or may not be the best 
approach for you. Check it out for yourself. We recommend that you ask an advisor who is 
qualified to review your finances to help you review your options. 
Step 3. How the process works 
If you decide to sell your life insurance policy to a viatical settlement provider, you will enter 
into a viatical settlement agreement with the provider. You, the seller, agree to accept a cash 
payment for your policy. The amount will be less than the face amount the policy would pay 
upon your death. (For example, you might agree to accept a $75,000 cash payment for a 
$100,000 policy) 
The viatical settlement provider buying your policy: 
A. becomes the new owner of your policy,B. names the beneficiary,C. collects the full death 
benefit when you die,D. begins paying premiums on the policy, andE. may sell your policy 
again. 
There are four basic phases required to complete a viatical transaction: 
A. Phase 1-Qualifying to sell your policy (underwriting) 
The viatical settlement provider will need information about you before making an offer. Usually 
it will take some preliminary information from you over the phone and send you this paperwork 
to sign: 
A medical release form so the viatical settlement provider can get and review your medical 
records an authorization form to contact your insurance company to confirm benefit, premium, 
and ownership of your policy. 
To avoid delays, it's important that you give complete and accurate information about your 
medical history. 
If you apply with more than one viatical settlement provider, each will contact your doctor for 
medical records and your insurance company for policy information. 
B. Phase 2-Calculating the offer 
The viatical settlement provider uses the information it gets in the underwriting phase to make an 
offer. To develop an offer, a viatical settlement provider takes into account various factors 
including: 
1. Estimated life expectancy and medical condition of the insured. Generally, the shorter the life 
expectancy of the insured, the more the viatical settlement provider will offer for the 
policy.2. The amount of life insurance coverage.3. Loans or advances, if any, previously taken 

against the policy.4. Amount of premiums necessary to keep the life insurance policy in 
force.5. The rating of the issuing insurance company.6. Prevailing interest rates.7. The minimum 
payment required by Mississippi Insurance Regulation.C. Phase 3-Closing the agreement 
If you accept an offer, a closing package is forwarded to you, the seller, for approval and 
signature. Closing documents typically include an offer letter, a viatical settlement contract, and 
the forms the insurance company needs to transfer ownership of the policy to the viatical 
settlement provider. 
The closing documents are then returned to the viatical settlement provider for its signature. 
The viatical settlement provider will put the cash payment owed to you in escrow, if required, 
and send the signed insurance change forms to the insurance company to record the change. 
Phase 4.Know your rights 
A. State laws 
Mississippi provides you with important consumer protections. You'll want to contact the 
Mississippi Insurance Department if you have any questions about the following consumer 
protections Mississippi requires: 
1. A viatical settlement broker or viatical settlement provider arranging viatical settlements must 
be licensed with the Mississippi Insurance Department.2. The viatical settlement provider buying 
your policy must keep your identity and medical history confidential unless you give written 
consent to tell others.3. To protect your proceeds, the viatical settlement provider buying your 
policy must put your money into an escrow account with an independent party during the 
transfer process.4. You have the right to change your mind about the settlement AFTER you 
receive the money, provided you return all the money. You have 15 days to review your 
settlement arrangement.5. The new owners of your policy are limited in how often they may 
contact you about your health status.B. Federal tax laws 
Two groups of people may receive benefits from a viatical settlement without owing federal 
income tax: 
1. persons who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and with a life expectancy of 24 
months or less; and certain chronically ill individuals.2. If you qualify for this federal tax-free 
treatment, you also must use a viatical settlement provider that is licensed in the state when you 
live, or, in states where licensing is not required, that complies with the standards of the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners' Viatical Settlements Model Act. 
Remember that, as when interpreting any tax laws, it's always best to check with your own 
financial advisor. 
C. Avoiding Consumer Fraud 
If you have been contacted by someone who wants you to buy a policy and then sell it 
immediately, you should contact your Mississippi Insurance Department. You may be a target 
for fraud. 

If you are asked to buy a life insurance policy for the sole purpose of selling it, you may be 
participating in fraud. 
If you are asked to invest in a viatical settlement, we recommend you contact the Mississippi 
Secretary of State's Office to learn more about the issues and risks that migh be involved in such 
an investment. 
Step 5. Check with your state insurance regulator 
A. State Licensing 
For a complete list of authorized viatical settlement providers, brokers, and their representatives, 
call the Mississippi Department of Insurance. 
B. Seller Checklist 
Before you sell your policy be sure you know the answers to these questions 
C. Evaluating your needs 
Do you still need life insurance? 
Do you have dependents who might rely on your life insurance benefits should anything happen 
to you? 
If you don't need life insurance protection now, what are the chances you'll need it in the future? 
D. Current policy benefits 
Can you borrow from the cash value? 
Can you cancel the policy for its current cash value? 
Can you use the cash value as collateral to get a loan from a financial institution? 
Do you have an accelerated death benefit feature? 
E. Taxes and other financial considerations 
Is the money you get from selling the policy taxable? 
Will the money you get from selling the policy affect your eligibility for government benefits? 
Do you need the advice of a tax or estate planning specialist before you decide to sell our policy? 
If you sell your policy, can any of your creditors claim the money? 
F. Understanding the process 
If you sell your policy, who will be the legal owner? 
Is the viatical settlement provider buying your policy licensed? 

If you sell your policy, how will the value you get be calculated? What interest rate will be used? 
If you sell your policy but then change your mind, can you get your money back? 
Will investors have specific information about you, your family or your health status? How are 
fees or commissions paid to the viatical settlement broker or provider?
